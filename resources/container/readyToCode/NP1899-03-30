      NIKOLA TESLA'S EXPERIMENTS.
                 ------
Receives Half-million-volt Current in His 
          Body Without Injury.
  New York, March 29.--The current issue
of the Electrical Review, of New York,
contains the first elaborate description
published of experiments carried on in
Nikola Tesla's laboratory, demonstrating
his recently announced discoveries in the
application of electricity to commercial
purposes without the use of conducting
wires.
  The experiments involve handling cur-
rents up to 8,000,000 volts, produced by
his perfect oscillators, with entire safety.
Photographs of the experiments actually
performed make it appear that not only
can the energy be transmitted in this 
manner, but also directed to any point
desired, regardless of distance and en-
vironment.
  In one illustration the inventor recieves
the electrical waves from a distance and 
develops a pressure of half a million volts
in a coil, which he holds in his hand, pre-
serving himself against injury by main-
taining a fixed position on the electrical
wave, where the pressure developed is
small. Another photograph shows an as-
sistant recieving in his body the curents
from an electrical oscillator, which pass
through his body and make a metar bar 
glow in his hands, also lighting a vaccuum
tube on the ceiling.
