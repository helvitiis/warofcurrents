TESLA'S ELECTRIC DISCOVERY.: The Electrical Review Pronounces His Experiments the 
Most Striking and Promising in Years.
Author Not SPecified
Abstract: The current issue of the Electrical Review contains the first elaborate 
description published of experiments carried on in Nikola Tesla's laboratory 
demonstrating his recently announced discoveries in the application of electricity
to commercial purposes without the use of conducting wires. The experiments involve 
the handling of currents up to 8,000,000 volts, produced by his perfected oscillators, 
with entire safety.
