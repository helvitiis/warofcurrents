    <!--2017-10-26 ebb: As we saw, when I associate your project schema, we see lots of red, and that's because a) the schema isn't quite finished, and b) this markup isn't following your rules. 
    SUGGESTIONS for your markup:
    * Each document should hold metadata: with information ABOUT who encoded the document, and observations about its source, etc. Should that content be part of your required <head> element? 
    
    * Think of the <body> element as holding the published material of the article. That means, you might represent the title twice: once up in the header as metadata, and once down in the body for rendering. Alternatively, you could decide that's overkill, and just handle processing the title from the head element when you go to transform this for the web.
    
    TEI's handling of titles and subtitles is inside a convenient element named <titleStmt>. You could use something like that to bundle together parts of titles, maybe like so:
   <head>
    <titleStmt> 
          <title>
          <subtitle n="1">
          (as many more of these subtitle elements as you need)

            <persName xml:id="Thomson">Prof. Ellihu Thomson</persName>, and many other earnest
        workers surpass in their laboratory experiments anything done behind the footlights. No
        Hindoo juggler can do more in the gentle art of mystifying than the electrician. His
        apparatus is simple and his results are amusing enough to sound a recall. <persName
            xml:id="#Edison">Thomas A. Edison</persName> several years ago had a small motor which
        ran without any apparent electrical. connection. It stood upon a table and whirled rapidly.
        It was very mystifying in the then stage of electrical science and savored of perpetual
        motion. The real secret lay in the fact that projecting from the base of the motor were two
        sharp metal pins which, when the motor was laid upon the table, penetrated the thin veneer
        of the table top and made connection with wires underneath. An electrician would disdain
        such a device now. Recent progress has shown that it is not necessary to have even the
        connecting wires. Motors now run and depend for their driving power on the electrical
        excitement of the atmosphere. They may bo far removed from the appliance generating the
        power and yet work away merrily. <persName xml:id="#Tesla">Tesla</persName> will hold a lamp
        in his band, stand in the middle of a largo room away from all wires or metallic
        connections, and the lamp will glow and send forth a radiance not to be equalled. What could
        be more magical than this?</p>
    <heading>THE SPINNING EGG.</heading>
    <p>Could <persName xml:id="#Columbus">Christopher Columbus</persName> have visited the <event
            loc="Chicago">Chicago Exposition</event> he would have found his trick of making an egg
        stand on end very much improved by aid of electricity. In one of the exhibits was a large
        egg on end upon a table. Visitors wondered what made that egg stand on end. Then it was
        discovered that the egg was not standing, but whirling—whirling with such rapidity that it
        seemed to stand still. Suddenly the egg stopped moving and fell down upon its side. Now,
        wonderful as this seemed, it is a very simple phenomenon, easily produced, and an everyday
        occurrence in the laboratory. The egg belonged to <persName xml:id="#Tesla">Nikola
            Tesla</persName>, and is at present in his laboratory in New York city. Inside the egg
        were arranged several coils of wire, and these were acted upon by several other coils near
        by, but unconnected by any mechanical process with the egg itself. </p>
    <heading>FREAKS OF THE ALTERNATING ELECTRIC CURRENT.</heading>
    <p>When the alternating current of electricity, as it is called, began to be understood several
        years ago, it was noticed that very peculiar phenomena were attendant on its action. When,
        for instance, a peculiarly wound coil of wire was placed near another coil that was
        traversed by an alternating current, a repulsive action took place, and the coils were
        driven away from each other. Under other conditions, attraction resulted. By manipulating
        the coils a series of attractions and repulsions were produced, and thus it became possible
        to get any number of strange effects, one of them being the apparent causeless whirling of
        the egg. Another is the action of a bunch of keys which, when thrown upon the table in place
        of the egg, whirls so rapidly that its form is indistinguishable. A copper plate or a copper
        ring ls affected precisely the same as the coll when place near an alternating current coll.
        It will be driven away or attracted. How easy, then, for the electrician to turn magician
        and mystify an audience. A simple cell underneath a table top will create more mystery for
        the uninitiated than a spiritualistic seance. The intervening wood of the table cuts no
        figure in the general calculation. The alternating current is a great leveler. it cares for
        nothing. A coll traversed by the current Will create all around it ah electrical atmosphere
        that will penetrate wood, glass, or anything else of the same nature. Prof. <persName
            xml:id="#Thomson">Elihu Thomson</persName> of Lynn, Mass., has performed a number of
        experiments which show the great possibilities for amusing which may be got out of the
        alternating current. </p>
    <heading>A MAGICAL HOOP.</heading>
    <p>In the same laboratory they take a metal plate and spin it on a pivot, not by any mechanical
        moans, but by surrounding the plate and pivot with what appears to bo a large , hoop
        attached to a handle. The hoop, however, is really the core of a large, electric coil, wire
        being wrapped round and round it, The repulsion and attraction set up in the hoop cause the
        metal plate to revolve. If the bunch of before mentioned were thrown on the table and within
        this hoop, it would whirl as rapidly as in the first instance. So would the egg. Prof.
            <persName xml:id="#Thomson">Thomson</persName> has described how he has laid a common
        steel file on a table underneath which a coll was fixed, and caused metal discs to revolve
        in his hands by merely holding the discs near to the filo But even this is not as curious as
        a feat performed in another laboratory not long since. A number of metal plates were laid
        out on a table as though in preparation for a dinner party. Then some people were asked to
        seat themselves at the table, and no sooner had they done so than the plates suddenly began
        to Jump into the air. Nothing could have been more startling, and there was a general and
        instanta neous stampede. Then it was disclosed that each plate had been laid directly above
        where a coil was placed under the Following is an idea obtained from the above, one of the
        persons present suggested that church contribution boxes could be made on this plan with
        curious results. Such a box has been made, and is simply impossible to get money to stay in
        it. Pennies especially have no liking for it and fly out in a surprising manner. </p>
    <heading>THE DANCING NAILS.</heading>
    <p>The same principle which governed the above was applied in another direction during an
        exhibition which was given by the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia some time ago. In the
        middle of the hall stood a plain pine table and on it was a handful of ordinary tenpenny
        nails. The nails lay in a heap and it looked as though some workman had thrown them there.
        Spectators were busy watching other things and the nails were passed with a glance. However,
        the eyes of one old lady and gentleman nearly popped out of their heads when happening to
        look at the nails, the latter all got up on end, heads up, and actually bowed and scraped to
        the astonished couple. The table was surrounded in an instant by astonished people, before
        whom the nails paired off and danced and waltzed. Some fell on their sides but immediately
        got up and bowed an apology. Coils beneath the table did it all. The head of the nails,
        containing more bulk than the points, sustained more repusive action and consefarthest away
        from the coil, which in its turn was regulated from another part of the room. </p>
    <heading>NIKOLA <persName xml:id="#Tesla">TESLA</persName>’S STARTLING EXPERIMENTS.</heading>
    <p>Mr. <persName xml:id="#Tesla">Tesla</persName>, in the course of a recent evening lecture,
        requested that the lights be turned, off it was done, and then the audience saw truly magic
        sight. There stood the electrician with a small lamp in his hand and his hand above his
        head. Rays of unequaled beauty came from the lamp and spread down over the body of the man.
        The lamp was a simple affair and no wires connecting it with a hidden source supply. It was
        as if the lamp of Aladdin had been rubbed and beautiful jewels were gleaming forth, this was
        followed by another and even more startling experiment. Again the room was, darkened. The
        lecturer became invisible to the expectant spectators and then a human hand, plaln and
        distinct, a hand of fire, reached out from the darkness and; all transparent, was seen
        waving aloft, while shooting out from it were sparks and streams of light. In exposition of
        these seeming wonders let me give Mr. <persName xml:id="#Tesla">Tesla</persName>’s own
        words: </p>
    <heading>
        <persName xml:id="#Tesla">TESLA</persName> EXPLAINS THE WONDERS.</heading>
    <p>"When two conducting bodies are insulated and electrified, we say that an electrostatic force
        is acting between them. This force manifests itself in attractions, repulsions and stresses
        in the bodies and space or medium without. So great may be the strain exerted in the air
        that it may break down, and we obeerve sparks of bundles of light or streamers, as they are
        called. These streamers form abundantly when the force through the air io rapidly varying. I
        will illustrate this action in a novel experiment in which I will employ an Induction coll.
        The coll is contained in a trough of oil and is placed under the table. The two ends of the.
        secondary wire of the coil pass, through two columns of hard rubber which protrude to some
        height above the table. Attached to one wire running through the hard rubber Is a large
        sphere of sheet brass. </p>
    <heading>THE FLYING RING.</heading>
    <p>Perhaps the most wonderful trick of all is the one in which the current overcomes the force
        of gravity. A short, stout column of wood stands upon .the laboratory table. Near by is a
        copperring, a trifle larger than the column. Concealed In that column of* wood is a coil
        traversed by an alternating current. Now, strange as it may seem, it is impossible to keep
        that ring on that column. Place it there and It will fly off the moment you take your hands
        away. Throw it on, it will balance itself in midair around the column until the electricity
        overcomes the force of gravity, and then it will fly away as before. The repulsive action
        lias taken place and forced the ring away from, the immediate neighborhood of the concealed
        coil. The effect is really magical. The ring can be made to stay near the coil in one way by
        taking advantage of the attractive faction. You may stand the ring on edge, as it were, on
        the projecting core of such a coll, and the attraction at this point will hold it firmly. </p>
    <heading>A LAMP THAT BURNS ONLY UNDER WATER.</heading>
    <p>It is one of the principles of the alternating current that when a coil is traversed by it,
        it has the power to induce a current to flow in another coil, if the latter is brought
        within the electric atmosphere of the first coil. Prof. <persName xml:id="#Thomson"
            >Thomson</persName> has taken advantage of this fact to produce a very mystifying and
        very beautiful experiment. You may walk into his laboratory some day and behold an
        incandescent, lamp floating around in a jar of water, and connected to a dynamo. You may
        safely, lift the lamp out of the water and examine it. The light will be extinguished
        immediately, and, if you will examine the lamp, a small coil will bo found in the base of
        it. Put the lamp back into the water, and it will immediately relight. Yet there is no
        substance in the water to cause the phenomenon. It is pure water. But there is a coil
        concealed under the table, traversed by a powerful alternating current. By means of it a
        current is induced in the coil, which is secured in the base of the lamp, and the latter is
        thus lighted. Such an affair, used upon the professional stage, would cause the greatest
        wonderment. The jar filled with water is merely used for effect, for if the lamp is taken
        out of the water and laid on the table it will light up just as quickly. Such an exhibition
        as this ought to cause grave forebodings to be experienced throughout the match trade. </p>
    <heading>BALLS AND PLATES SPINNING UNDER WATER.</heading>
    <p>The queerest aquarium in existence, probably, is owned by Prof. Thomson. For it he uses the
        same jar and water in which the lamp was exhibited. His fish are differently shaped and
        constructed from any that ply the sea. In fact, they consist of some small metal balls and a
        metal plate. Tossed lightly into the water they immediately revolve at a speed sufficient to
        churn up the liquid to a degree. They strike each other and careen from side to side at a
        great rate, and the physical action to very instructive and interesting to watch. As in the
        case of the lamp, the water is not necessary. The balls may be laid on the plate on the
        table and they will whirl as fast as did <persName xml:id="#Tesla">Tesla</persName>'s egg.
        It is the old story of the coil concealed beneath the table. “I now set the coil to work and
        approach the free terminal with a metallic object held in my band, this simply to avoid
        burns. As I approach the metallic object to a distance of eight or ten inches, a torrent of
        furious sparks breaks forth from the end of the secondary wire which passes through the
        rubber column. The sparks cease when the metal In my hand touches the wire. My arm is now
        traversed by a powerful electric current, vibrating at the rate of one million times a
        second. All around me the electrostatic force makes itself felt, and the air molecules and
        particles of dust flying about are acted upon and are hammering violently against my body.
        So great is the agitation of the particles that when the lights are turned out you may see
        streams of feeble light appear on some parts of my body. “I can make these streams of light
        visible to all by touching with the metallic object one of the terminals as before, and
        approaching my free band to the brass sphere which is connected to the other terminal of the
        coil. As the hand is approached, the air between it and the sphere, or in the immediate
        neighborhood, is more violently agitated, and you see streams of light break forth from my
        finger tips and from the whole band."</p>
