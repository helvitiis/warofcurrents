        <p>About a year and a half ago while engaged in the study of <current type="AC">alternate currents</current> of short
            period, it occurred to me that such currents could be obtained by rotating charged
            surfaces in close proximity to conductors. Accordingly I devised various forms of
            experimental apparatus of which two are illustrated in the accompanying engravings. </p>
        <p>Fig. 1. <persName>Tesla</persName> Alternating Electrostatic Induction Apparatus In the apparatus shown in
            Fig. 1, A is a ring of dry shellacked hard wood provided on its inside with two sets of
            tin-foil coatings, a and b, all the a coatings and all the b coatings being connected
            together, respectively, but independent from each other. These two sets of coatings are
            connected to two terminals, T. For the sake of clearness only a few coatings are shown.
            Inside of the ring A, and in close proximity to it there is arranged to rotate a
            cylinder B, likewise of dry, shellacked hard wood, and provided with two similar sets of
            coatings, a1 and b1, all the coatings a1 being connected to one ring and all the others,
            b1, to another marked + and . These two sets, a1 and b1 are charged to a high potential
            by a Holtz or a Wimshurst machine, and may be connected to a jar of some capacity. The
            inside of ring A is coated with mica in order to increase the induction and also to
            allow higher potentials to be used.</p>
        <p>Fig. 2. <persName>Tesla</persName> Alternating Electrostatic Induction Apparatus When the cylinder B with the
            charged coatings is rotated, a circuit connected to the terminals T is traversed by
            <current type="AC">alternating currents</current>. Another form of apparatus is illustrated in Fig. 2. In this
            apparatus the two sets of tin-foil coatings are glued on a plate of ebonite, and a
            similar plate which is rotated, and the coatings of which are charged as in Fig. 1, is
            provided.</p>
        <p>The output of such an apparatus is very small, but some of the effects peculiar to
            <current type="AC">alternating currents</current> of short periods may be observed. The effects, however, cannot be
            compared with those obtainable with an induction coil which is operated by an <current type="AC">alternate
            current</current> machine of high frequency, some of which were described by me a short while
            ago.</p>
