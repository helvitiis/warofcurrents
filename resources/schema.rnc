start = document
document = element document {head, body, foot}
head = element head {publisher, pubDate, filetype, title, author, url}
publisher = element publisher {text}
pubDate = element pubdate {xsd:date}
filetype = element filetype {"newspaper" | "advertisement" | "journal" | "other"}
title = element title {text}
author = element author {text}

body = element body {images?, placeName?, date?, persName?, event?, patent?, text}
placeName = element placeName {text}
date = element date {xsd:date} #quantum-satire: Note that date differs from pubDate.
persName = element persName {type, text}
type = attribute type {"inventor" | "engineer" | "businessman" | "banker" | "other"} #quantum-satire: We'll need to 
look while we mark up our documents the types of people mentioned in order for us to make a comprehensive list for 
the schema. For now, I'm adding what I feel may come up most often. Only use the "other" category if <2 people fit 
a particular category (i.e. one person is a farmer, we won't need to make a new category named "farmer" for that 
individual--the list would be too long at that point.) If an individual fits more than one category, choose the 
category that best describes them or they are most well-known for.
event = element event {text} #quantum-satire: Events include public demonstrations, important milestones for AC 
and/or DC current, and important milestones in the lives of the prominent figures associated with them.
patent = element patent {pNo}
pNo = attribute pNo {xsd:integer} #quantum-satire: pNo = patent number, which will be useful to note when we link out 
to the patents and include images of them. Do NOT include the comma.
images = element images {text}

foot = element foot {url}
url = element url {text}
#quantum-satire: We're going to also be marking up types of language used in the documents, however, I haven't decided 
on how we're going to do that yet. For now, mark what you can out of the above listed...
