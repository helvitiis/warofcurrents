This includes (but is not limited to) the public view of AC and DC current, the advertising and publicity (overall negative or positive adjectives and verbage used to describe them), public demonstrations, contributing figures (and who was the most/least mentioned), areas where electricity was most implimented, and a timeline to represent the dates of major events in the history of AC and DC current.
