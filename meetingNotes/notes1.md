### Building the project corpus
How to locate sources to work with:

Need this to be already transcribed or OCR'd, so you can copy/paste into new files for markup.
Resources: 

### Pitt Digital Library: JSTOR Advanced Search
--Keep a record of search terms you try
--Try to locate maybe a cluster of journals/publications that contain interesting material
* Scientific American
* others?

### New York Times:
look for already transcribed articles in these "attics" of websites on Tesla
* Inventions & Experiments of Nikola Tesla (Article & Interviews) https://teslaresearch.jimdo.com/articles-interviews/
* Tesla Universe: https://teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla/articles

Are there similar "attics" of transcribed pages available on Edison and DC? 

### Current stuff on DC current 
Scientific American (past 10/ 20 years? JSTOR?)
