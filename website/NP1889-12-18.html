        <p>The problem of obtaining continuous currents from alternating is one that has received
            not a little attention, and various solutions have been offered on both sides of the
            Atlantic. The New York correspondent of the Electrician says that Mr. Nikola Tesla has
            applied himself to the matter, and now offers a simple and ingenious solution. His idea
            and method consist broadly in directing the waves of an alternating current so as to
            produce continuous currents by developing in the branches of an alternating-current
            circuit certain manifestations of energy or active opposite resistances by which the
            alternating-current waves of opposite sign are diverted through different circuits. Thus
            the currents of different sign are, so to speak, sifted out: those of one sign passing
            over one branch, and those of an opposite sign over the other. There may thus be
            obtained from an alternating current two or more direct currents without the employment
            of a commutator. Mr. Tesla proposes both electrical and electro-magnetic methods for
            achieving this result. In the electrical method the device to create an electromotive
            force counter to the waves of current on one side may, for example, be batteries or
            continuous-current machines. In the electro-magnetic method, instead of producing the
            electromotive force in each branch of the circuit, a field of force may be established,
            and the branches be led through it in such a manner that an active opposition will be
            developed therein by the passage, or tendency to pass, of the alternations of current.
            Another purely magnetic method is that wherein Mr. Tesla employs two strong permanent
            magnets, the armatures of which are built up of thin laminae of soft iron or steel, the
            amount of magnetic metal which they contain being so calculated that they will be nearly
            or fully saturated by the magnets.</p>
