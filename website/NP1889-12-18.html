        <h2>CONTINUOUS CURRENTS FROM ALTERNATING CURRENTS.</h2>
        <p>The problem of obtaining continuous currents from <current type="AC"
                >alternating</current> is one that has received not a little attention, and various
            solutions have been offered on both sides of <loc>the Atlantic</loc>. The <loc>New
                York</loc> correspondent of the Electrician says that <persName ref="#Tesla">Mr.
                Nikola Tesla</persName> has applied himself to the matter, and now offers a simple
            and ingenious solution. His idea and method consist broadly in directing the waves of an
                <current type="AC">alternating current</current> so as to produce continuous
            currents by developing in the branches of an <current type="AC"
                >alternating-current</current> circuit certain manifestations of energy or active
            opposite resistances by which the <current type="AC">alternating-current</current> waves
            of opposite sign are diverted through different circuits. Thus the currents of different
            sign are, so to speak, sifted out: those of one sign passing over one branch, and those
            of an opposite sign over the other. There may thus be obtained from an <current
                type="AC">alternating current</current> two or more <current type="DC">direct
                currents</current> without the employment of a commutator. <persName ref="#Tesla"
                >Mr. Tesla</persName> proposes both electrical and electro-magnetic methods for
            achieving this result. In the electrical method the device to create an electromotive
            force counter to the waves of current on one side may, for example, be batteries or
            continuous-current machines. In the electro-magnetic method, instead of producing the
            electromotive force in each branch of the circuit, a field of force may be established,
            and the branches be led through it in such a manner that an active opposition will be
            developed therein by the passage, or tendency to pass, of the <current type="AC"
                >alternations of current</current>. Another purely magnetic method is that wherein
                <persName ref="#Tesla">Mr. Tesla</persName> employs two strong permanent magnets,
            the armatures of which are built up of thin laminae of soft iron or steel, the amount of
            magnetic metal which they contain being so calculated that they will be nearly or fully
            saturated by the magnets.</p>
