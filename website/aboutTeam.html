            <h3>Ally Hall</h3>
            <p>Ally is a double Scientific Journalism and IT major at the University of Pittsburgh
                at Greensburg (Class of 2021). She enjoys studying physics and electrical
                engineering in her free time and has an interest in electronics and how they work.
                The project idea came to her after picking up a biography about Nikola Tesla a year
                prior to taking the Digital Humanities course, and she acted as the team leader for
                the development of this project. The schema design, graphic design of the website,
                transcription and some markup of documents were done by her.</p>
