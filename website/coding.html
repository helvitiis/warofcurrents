        <p>For the War of Currents project, we used several coding languages in building the
            website, marking up text, and structuring the data.</p>
        <h3>XML</h3>
        <p>Short for <span style="color: #123C56;">eXtensible Markup Language</span>. It's used for
            storing and accessing information, providing an excellent method for marking up our
            documents. It's also cross-platform and used freely around the world.</p>

        &lt;p&gt;Any one of our modern electrical scientists could, by departing from the dignity of his
            calling, launch out as a professional magician and make a fortune on the stage.
            &lt;persName ref="#Tesla"&gt;Nikola Tesla&lt;/persName&gt;, &lt;persName ref="#Edison" 
            &gt;Edison&lt;/persName&gt;,&lt;persName ref="#Thomson"&gt;Prof. Ellihu Thomson&lt;/persName&gt;, and
            many other earnest workers surpass in their laboratory experiments anything done behind
            the footlights. No Hindoo juggler can do more in the gentle art of mystifying than the
            electrician. His apparatus is simple and his results are amusing enough to sound a
            recall. &lt;persName ref="#Edison"&gt;Thomas A. Edison&lt;/persName&gt; several years ago had a
            small motor which ran without any apparent electrical. connection. It stood upon a table
            and whirled rapidly. It was very mystifying in the then stage of electrical science and
            savored of perpetual motion. The real secret lay in the fact that projecting from the
            base of the motor were two sharp metal pins which, when the motor was laid upon the
            table, penetrated the thin veneer of the table top and made connection with wires
            underneath. An electrician would disdain such a device now. Recent progress has shown
            that it is not necessary to have even the connecting wires. Motors now run and depend
            for their driving power on the electrical excitement of the atmosphere. They may bo far
            removed from the appliance generating the power and yet work away merrily. &lt;persName 
            ref="#Tesla"&gt;Tesla&lt;/persName&gt; will hold a lamp in his band, stand in the middle 
            of a large room away from all wires or metallic connections, and the lamp will glow and 
            send forth a radiance not to be equalled. What could be more magical than this?&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;

        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>Short for <span style="color: #123C56;">HyperText Markup Language</span>. HTML and XML
            are similar languages, but HTML is used for presentation and display while XML is used
            for the storage of information. We used HTML in conjunction with CSS to build and style
            our website.</p>
        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>Short for <span style="color: #123C56;">Cascading Stylesheets</span>. CSS is used to
            style code and display it on websites.</p>
        <h3>JS</h3>
        <p>Short for <span style="color: #123C56;">JavaScript</span>. JS was used to create our menu
            bar, making it dynamic and more functional than a menu might be without using a language
            other than HTML. Here is the code we used for the JS portion of our menu.</p>
