            <h2>What was the "War of Currents?"</h2>
            <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_Currents">"War of Currents"</a>
                wasn't really a war, but more of a vehement contest that transpired in the early
                1900s between two types of electrical current used to power the cities (and much
                more). The war <i>sparked</i> a media frenzy of propaganda, public demonstrations,
                and rules and regulations contrived to make electricity safe for the public.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>So, what's the project about?</h2>
            <p>We want to inform the public about the historical application and implications or
                views of AC versus DC current. This includes (but is not limited to) the public view
                of AC and DC current, the advertising and publicity (overall negative or positive
                adjectives and verbage used to describe them), public demonstrations, contributing
                figures (and who was the most/least mentioned), areas where electricity was most
                implimented, and a timeline to represent the dates of major events in the history of
                AC and DC current. We also aim to calalogue and produce an archive of important
                source material pertinent to the War of Currents, making it accessible to the
                internet.</p>
            <br />
            <h2>How did we do it?</h2>
            <p>You can read about how we went about the coding for the project <a href="coding.html"
                    style="color:#123C56">here.</a></p>
            <br />
            <h2>The Results</h2>
            <p>Update with finished project.</p>
