        <h2>What was the "War of Currents?"</h2>
        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_Currents">"War of Currents"</a> wasn't
            really a war, but more of a vehement contest that transpired in the early 1900s between
            two types of electrical current used to power the cities (and much more). The war
                <i>sparked</i> a media frenzy of propaganda, public demonstrations, and rules and
            regulations contrived to make electricity safe for the public.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>So, what's the project about?</h2>
        <p>We want to inform the public about the historical application and implications or views
            of AC versus DC current. This includes (but is not limited to) the public view of AC and
            DC current, the advertising and publicity (overall negative or positive adjectives and
            verbage used to describe them), public demonstrations, contributing figures (and who was
            the most/least mentioned), areas where electricity was most implimented, and a timeline
            to represent the dates of major events in the history of AC and DC current. We also aim
            to calalogue and produce an archive of important source material pertinent to the War of
            Currents, making it accessible to the internet.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>How did we do it?</h2>
        <p>You can read about how we went about the coding for the project <a href="coding.html"
                >here.</a> The research and main body of work consisted of sifting through hundreds
            of newspaper articles photographed and hosted through databases. We used an Optical
            Character Recognition (OCR) machine to help us transcribe these clippings, then
            transferred them to Oxygen XML Editor to markup by hand. This process took roughly 70%
            of our total project time and presented a major challenge in collecting the documents
            themselves.</p>
        <br />
