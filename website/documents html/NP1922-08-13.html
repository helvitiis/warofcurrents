            <h2>CONSERVING ELECTRICITY.</h2>
            <h2>New Machine Transmits High-Pressure Direct Current</h2>
            <p>Great interest has been aroused in <loc>England</loc> by experiments now in progress
                with a method of transmission by high-pressure <current type="DC">direct
                    current</current> instead of by high-pressure <current type="AC">alternating
                    current</current>, details of which are described in the Engineering Supplement
                of The <loc>London</loc> Times. The machine employed, which is the invention of
                Highfield and Calverley, is known as a "transverter," and consists of a transformer
                for stepping up the pressure of the three-phase current generated by the
                turbo-alternators and of several rotating commutators for converting the <current
                    type="AC">alternating current</current> into <current type="DC">direct
                    current</current>.</p>
            <p>By connecting these commutators in series, the <current type="DC"
                    >direct-current</current> pressure of each is added to that of the one behind
                it. In the experimental transverters which have been working for the last sixteen
                months the pressure is 100,000 volts, but it is thought that this might possibly be
                doubled.</p>
            <p>Assuming, however, that <current type="DC">direct-current</current> transmission is
                limited to 100,000 volts, this would more than double the economic railway
                distribution radius, and it is possible that if higher pressures can be used the
                distribution radius to 100 miles. As the machine is reversible, transverters are
                employed at the recieving end to convert the <current type="DC">direct
                    current</current> into three-phase or single-phase, or to reduce the <current
                    type="DC">direct-current</current> pressure to that require for traction
                purposes.</p>
            <p>The new machine has not yet been tried commercially, but it is understood that
                transverters are being built by the <company name="Other">English Electric
                    Company</company> which, it is hoped, will be in commercial service in
                    <loc>London</loc> this year.</p>
