            <h2>NIKOLA TESLA'S EXPERIMENTS.</h2>
            <h2>Receives Half-million-volt Current in His Body Without Injury.</h2>
            <p><loc>New York</loc>, <date xsd="1899-03-29">March 29</date>.--The current issue of
                the Electrical Review, of <loc>New York</loc>, contains the first elaborate
                description published of experiments carried on in <persName ref="#Tesla">Nikola
                    Tesla's</persName> laboratory, demonstrating his recently announced discoveries
                in the application of electricity to commercial purposes without the use of
                conducting wires.</p>
            <p>The experiments involve handling currents up to 8,000,000 volts, produced by his
                perfect oscillators, with entire safety. Photographs of the experiments actually
                performed make it appear that not only can the energy be transmitted in this manner,
                but also directed to any point desired, regardless of distance and environment.</p>
            <p>In one illustration the inventor recieves the electrical waves from a distance and
                develops a pressure of half a million volts in a coil, which he holds in his hand,
                preserving himself against injury by maintaining a fixed position on the electrical
                wave, where the pressure developed is small. Another photograph shows an assistant
                recieving in his body the curents from an electrical oscillator, which pass through
                his body and make a metar bar glow in his hands, also lighting a vaccuum tube on the
                ceiling.</p>
