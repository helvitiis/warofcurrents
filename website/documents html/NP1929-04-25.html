            <h2>TESTIMONY OF SLOAN ASKED IN RATE CASE</h2>
            <h2>Pooley Wants Statement of Edison Company's Head on Direct Current System</h2>
            <p>At the hearing yesterday on the complaint of John F. Hylan, made when he was Mayor,
                that rates for electric current charged by the Edison companies were too high,
                Public Service <persName ref="#Other">Commissioner Pooley</persName> announced that
                    <persName ref="#Other">Matthew S. Sloan</persName>, president of the <loc>New
                    York</loc>
                <company name="Edison">Edison Company</company>, had been asked to testify when the
                hearing is resumed next Tuesday. At the hearings by the Public Service Commission on
                submetering <persName ref="#Other">Mr. Sloan</persName> testified that if the
                profits made by the submeter concerns had not been diverted from the electric
                companies it would have been possible to reduce the rates.</p>
            <p><persName ref="#Other">Commissioner Pooley</persName>, it was explained, wants to
                learn the policy of the <company name="Edison">Edison Company</company> concerning
                the extension or discontinuance of the <current type="DC">direct current</current>
                system. The commission contends that this system is more costly to operate and
                maintain than the more modern system of <current type="AC">alternating
                    current</current>. It was suggested that it might be possible to obtain a
                reduction in the rates for electric current if the company adopted the most
                economical methods of operation.</p>
            <p>Reports were submitted to show that the return on the investment of the company will
                yield only a little more than 4 per cent this year, instead of the 8 per cent
                allowed by law. This report was submitted by <persName ref="#Other">Henry M.
                    Edwards</persName>, vice president of the company on charge of accounting.</p>
            <p>According to this estimate, the total value of the company's investment will amount
                to $469,474,730.19 by the end of the year. This indicates that the value has almost
                doubled since July 1, 1924. At that time <persName ref="#Other">Dr. William
                    McClellan</persName>, on behalf of the commission, submitted an estimate showing
                that the value was $245,574,784.66, which was about $100,000,000 lower that the
                company's estimate.</p>
