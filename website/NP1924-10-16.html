        <h2>BUYS SEVEN LOCOMOTIVES.</h2>
        <h2>New Haven Engines to Use Both Alternating and Direct Current</h2>
        <p>Seven electric locomotives of a new type have been ordered by the <loc>New York</loc>,
                <loc>New Haven</loc> &amp; <loc>Hartford</loc> Railroad from the <company
                name="Other">General Electric Company</company>. It was announced yesterday. They
            will use both <current type="AC">alternating</current> and <current type="DC">direct
                current</current>. Each will be a "traveling substation" capable of picking up the
                <current type="AC">alternating current</current> of 11,000 volts from the overhead
            wires and changing it to the <current type="DC">direct current</current> used to operate
            the driving motors. It is more economical to transmit the <current type="AC">alternating
                current</current> in large voltage over long distances. At the same time,
            demonstrations have proved, according to the electric construction companies, that the
                <current type="DC">direct current</current> motor has advantages over the <current
                type="AC">alternating</current> motor.</p>
        <p>An electric locomotive upon which <persName ref="#Other">Henry Ford</persName> and his
            corps of engineers are now working in connection with the <company name="Westinghouse"
                >Westinghouse Electric Company</company> takes into consideration the same
            principles. These locomotives will be ready for use shortly and it has been promised by
            the electrical engineers who have been working on them that they will revolutionize the
            electric development on the railroads.</p>
        <p>Five of the new locomotives which have been ordered by the <loc>New York</loc>, <loc>New
                Haven</loc> &amp; <loc>Hartford</loc> will be used for freight service on the main
            line from <loc>Oak Point, N.Y.</loc>, to <loc>New Haven</loc>. The other two will be
            placed in yard service.</p>
