                <span class="persName">Robert B. Thomas</span>, counsel for the <span
                    class="company">Structural Steel Board of Trade, Inc.</span>, appeared before
                    <span class="persName">Chairman Prendergast</span> of the Public Service
                Commission yesterday in support of the complaint of the board that the <span
                    class="loc">New York</span>
                <span class="company">Edison Company</span> had refused to furnish <span
                    class="current">direct current</span> to contractors for the temporary use
                during the construction of buildings.</p>
            <p>The <span class="company">Edison Company</span>, after a study of the situation in
                its territory, determined to supply <span class="current">alternating current</span>
                to all consumers except those who had installed <span class="current">direct
                    current</span> equipment in buildings. This situation remains. <span
                    class="persName">Mr. Thomas</span> said that the cost of the <span
                    class="current">direct current</span> equipment used by contractors was in some
                cases in excess of $50,000. He protested against any situation that would mean the
                scrapping of it.</p>
            <p>He asserted that the company had encouraged builders to provide themselves with this
                costly equipment and thought the company should pay for it if a change in the method
                of furnishing current had destroyed its value. It was explained that <span
                    class="current">alternating current</span> was rapidly taking the place of <span
                    class="current">direct current</span> throughout the country, because it was
                cheaper to install and to operate. This <span class="current">direct current</span>
                equipment, <span class="persName">Mr. Thomas</span> said, had cost steel contractors
                at least $2,000,000. It was suggested that it would only be fair if the company
                continued to supply <span class="current">direct current</span> to those contractors
                who wanted it until their equipment was worn out, which might occur in ten
                years.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="persName">William L. Ransom</span>, counsel for the company, said that
                its president, <span class="persName">Matthew S. Sloan</span>, would not consent to
                the company's plant that would only serve a temporary purpose. At a hearing before
                the commission on <span class="date">May 27</span>, last, representatives of
                building firms which are members of the <span class="company">Steel Board of
                    Trade</span>, said that <span class="persName">Mr. Sloan</span> was dictatorial
                and responsible for innovations that were troublesome.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="persName">Chairman Prendergast</span> won a promise from <span
                    class="persName">Mr. Ransom</span> that the company would supply <span
                    class="current">direct current</span> to building contractors whenever it was
                possible without further investment on the company's part. If the company and the
                contractors cannot reach an amicable agreement he later were told that they could
                file a formal complaint with the commission and that hearings would be held so that
                the case might be fully inquired into.</p>

            <p>Any one of our modern electrical scientists could, by departing from the dignity of
                his calling, launch out as a professional magician and make a fortune on the stage.
                    <span class="persName">Nikola Tesla</span>, <span class="persName"
                >Edison</span>, <span class="persName">Prof. Ellihu Thomson</span>, and many other
                earnest workers surpass in their laboratory experiments anything done behind the
                footlights. No Hindoo juggler can do more in the gentle art of mystifying than the
                electrician. His apparatus is simple and his results are amusing enough to sound a
                recall. <span class="persName">Thomas A. Edison</span> several years ago had a small
                motor which ran without any apparent electrical. connection. It stood upon a table
                and whirled rapidly. It was very mystifying in the then stage of electrical science
                and savored of perpetual motion. The real secret lay in the fact that projecting
                from the base of the motor were two sharp metal pins which, when the motor was laid
                upon the table, penetrated the thin veneer of the table top and made connection with
                wires underneath. An electrician would disdain such a device now. Recent progress
                has shown that it is not necessary to have even the connecting wires. Motors now run
                and depend for their driving power on the electrical excitement of the atmosphere.
                They may bo far removed from the appliance generating the power and yet work away
                merrily. <span class="persName">Tesla</span> will hold a lamp in his band, stand in
                the middle of a largo room away from all wires or metallic connections, and the lamp
                will glow and send forth a radiance not to be equalled. What could be more magical
                than this?</p> THE SPINNING EGG. <p>Could <span class="persName">Christopher
                    Columbus</span> have visited the <span class="event">Chicago Exposition</span>
                he would have found his trick of making an egg stand on end very much improved by
                aid of electricity. In one of the exhibits was a large egg on end upon a table.
                Visitors wondered what made that egg stand on end. Then it was discovered that the
                egg was not standing, but whirling—whirling with such rapidity that it seemed to
                stand still. Suddenly the egg stopped moving and fell down upon its side. Now,
                wonderful as this seemed, it is a very simple phenomenon, easily produced, and an
                everyday occurrence in the laboratory. The egg belonged to <span class="persName"
                    >Nikola Tesla</span>, and is at present in his laboratory in <span class="loc"
                    >New York city</span>. Inside the egg were arranged several coils of wire, and
                these were acted upon by several other coils near by, but unconnected by any
                mechanical process with the egg itself. </p>
            <h3>FREAKS OF THE ALTERNATING ELECTRIC CURRENT.</h3>
            <p>When the <span class="current">alternating current</span> of electricity, as it is
                called, began to be understood several years ago, it was noticed that very peculiar
                phenomena were attendant on its action. When, for instance, a peculiarly wound coil
                of wire was placed near another coil that was traversed by an <span class="current"
                    >alternating current</span>, a repulsive action took place, and the coils were
                driven away from each other. Under other conditions, attraction resulted. By
                manipulating the coils a series of attractions and repulsions were produced, and
                thus it became possible to get any number of strange effects, one of them being the
                apparent causeless whirling of the egg. Another is the action of a bunch of keys
                which, when thrown upon the table in place of the egg, whirls so rapidly that its
                form is indistinguishable. A copper plate or a copper ring ls affected precisely the
                same as the coll when place near an <span class="current">alternating current</span>
                coil. It will be driven away or attracted. How easy, then, for the electrician to
                turn magician and mystify an audience. A simple cell underneath a table top will
                create more mystery for the uninitiated than a spiritualistic seance. The
                intervening wood of the table cuts no figure in the general calculation. The <span
                    class="current">alternating current</span> is a great leveler. it cares for
                nothing. A coil traversed by the current Will create all around it an electrical
                atmosphere that will penetrate wood, glass, or anything else of the same nature.
                    <span class="persName"> Prof. Elihu Thomson</span> of <span class="loc">Lynn,
                    Mass.</span>, has performed a number of experiments which show the great
                possibilities for amusing which may be got out of the <span class="current"
                    >alternating current</span>. </p>
            <h3>A MAGICAL HOOP.</h3>
            <p>In the same laboratory they take a metal plate and spin it on a pivot, not by any
                mechanical moans, but by surrounding the plate and pivot with what appears to bo a
                large, hoop attached to a handle. The hoop, however, is really the core of a large,
                electric coil, wire being wrapped round and round it, The repulsion and attraction
                set up in the hoop cause the metal plate to revolve. If the bunch of before
                mentioned were thrown on the table and within this hoop, it would whirl as rapidly
                as in the first instance. So would the egg. <span class="persName">Prof.
                    Thomson</span> has described how he has laid a common steel file on a table
                underneath which a coil was fixed, and caused metal discs to revolve in his hands by
                merely holding the discs near to the filo But even this is not as curious as a feat
                performed in another laboratory not long since. A number of metal plates were laid
                out on a table as though in preparation for a dinner party. Then some people were
                asked to seat themselves at the table, and no sooner had they done so than the
                plates suddenly began to Jump into the air. Nothing could have been more startling,
                and there was a general and instanta neous stampede. Then it was disclosed that each
                plate had been laid directly above where a coil was placed under the Following is an
                idea obtained from the above, one of the persons present suggested that church
                contribution boxes could be made on this plan with curious results. Such a box has
                been made, and is simply impossible to get money to stay in it. Pennies especially
                have no liking for it and fly out in a surprising manner. </p>
            <h3>THE DANCING NAILS.</h3>
            <p>The same principle which governed the above was applied in another direction during
                an exhibition which was given by the <span class="loc">Franklin Institute of
                    Philadelphia</span> some time ago. In the middle of the hall stood a plain pine
                table and on it was a handful of ordinary tenpenny nails. The nails lay in a heap
                and it looked as though some workman had thrown them there. Spectators were busy
                watching other things and the nails were passed with a glance. However, the eyes of
                one old lady and gentleman nearly popped out of their heads when happening to look
                at the nails, the latter all got up on end, heads up, and actually bowed and scraped
                to the astonished couple. The table was surrounded in an instant by astonished
                people, before whom the nails paired off and danced and waltzed. Some fell on their
                sides but immediately got up and bowed an apology. Coils beneath the table did it
                all. The head of the nails, containing more bulk than the points, sustained more
                repusive action and consefarthest away from the coil, which in its turn was
                regulated from another part of the room. </p>
            <h3><span class="persName">NIKOLA TESLA</span>’S STARTLING EXPERIMENTS.</h3>
            <p>Mr. <span class="persName">Tesla</span>, in the course of a recent evening lecture,
                requested that the lights be turned, off it was done, and then the audience saw
                truly magic sight. There stood the electrician with a small lamp in his hand and his
                hand above his head. Rays of unequaled beauty came from the lamp and spread down
                over the body of the man. The lamp was a simple affair and no wires connecting it
                with a hidden source supply. It was as if the lamp of Aladdin had been rubbed and
                beautiful jewels were gleaming forth, this was followed by another and even more
                startling experiment. Again the room was, darkened. The lecturer became invisible to
                the expectant spectators and then a human hand, plaln and distinct, a hand of fire,
                reached out from the darkness and; all transparent, was seen waving aloft, while
                shooting out from it were sparks and streams of light. In exposition of these
                seeming wonders let me give Mr. <span class="persName">Tesla</span>’s own words: </p>
            <span class="persName">TESLA</span> EXPLAINS THE WONDERS. <p>"When two conducting bodies
                are insulated and electrified, we say that an electrostatic force is acting between
                them. This force manifests itself in attractions, repulsions and stresses in the
                bodies and space or medium without. So great may be the strain exerted in the air
                that it may break down, and we obeerve sparks of bundles of light or streamers, as
                they are called. These streamers form abundantly when the force through the air io
                rapidly varying. I will illustrate this action in a novel experiment in which I will
                employ an Induction coll. The coll is contained in a trough of oil and is placed
                under the table. The two ends of the. secondary wire of the coil pass, through two
                columns of hard rubber which protrude to some height above the table. Attached to
                one wire running through the hard rubber Is a large sphere of sheet brass. </p>
            <h3>THE FLYING RING.</h3>
            <p>Perhaps the most wonderful trick of all is the one in which the current overcomes the
                force of gravity. A short, stout column of wood stands upon .the laboratory table.
                Near by is a copperring, a trifle larger than the column. Concealed In that column
                of* wood is a coil traversed by an <span class="current">alternating current</span>.
                Now, strange as it may seem, it is impossible to keep that ring on that column.
                Place it there and It will fly off the moment you take your hands away. Throw it on,
                it will balance itself in midair around the column until the electricity overcomes
                the force of gravity, and then it will fly away as before. The repulsive action lias
                taken place and forced the ring away from, the immediate neighborhood of the
                concealed coil. The effect is really magical. The ring can be made to stay near the
                coil in one way by taking advantage of the attractive faction. You may stand the
                ring on edge, as it were, on the projecting core of such a coll, and the attraction
                at this point will hold it firmly. </p>
            <h3>A LAMP THAT BURNS ONLY UNDER WATER. </h3><p>It is one of the principles of the <span
                    class="current">alternating current</span> that when a coil is traversed by it,
                it has the power to induce a current to flow in another coil, if the latter is
                brought within the electric atmosphere of the first coil. <span class="persName"
                    >Prof. Thomson</span> has taken advantage of this fact to produce a very
                mystifying and very beautiful experiment. You may walk into his laboratory some day
                and behold an incandescent, lamp floating around in a jar of water, and connected to
                a dynamo. You may safely, lift the lamp out of the water and examine it. The light
                will be extinguished immediately, and, if you will examine the lamp, a small coil
                will bo found in the base of it. Put the lamp back into the water, and it will
                immediately relight. Yet there is no substance in the water to cause the phenomenon.
                It is pure water. But there is a coil concealed under the table, traversed by a
                powerful alternating current. By means of it a current is induced in the coil, which
                is secured in the base of the lamp, and the latter is thus lighted. Such an affair,
                used upon the professional stage, would cause the greatest wonderment. The jar
                filled with water is merely used for effect, for if the lamp is taken out of the
                water and laid on the table it will light up just as quickly. Such an exhibition as
                this ought to cause grave forebodings to be experienced throughout the match trade. </p>
            <h3>BALLS AND PLATES SPINNING UNDER WATER.</h3>
            <p>The queerest aquarium in existence, probably, is owned by <span class="persName"
                    >Prof. Thomson</span>. For it he uses the same jar and water in which the lamp
                was exhibited. His fish are differently shaped and constructed from any that ply the
                sea. In fact, they consist of some small metal balls and a metal plate. Tossed
                lightly into the water they immediately revolve at a speed sufficient to churn up
                the liquid to a degree. They strike each other and careen from side to side at a
                great rate, and the physical action to very instructive and interesting to watch. As
                in the case of the lamp, the water is not necessary. The balls may be laid on the
                plate on the table and they will whirl as fast as did <span class="persName"
                    >Tesla</span>'s egg. It is the old story of the coil concealed beneath the
                table. “I now set the coil to work and approach the free terminal with a metallic
                object held in my band, this simply to avoid burns. As I approach the metallic
                object to a distance of eight or ten inches, a torrent of furious sparks breaks
                forth from the end of the secondary wire which passes through the rubber column. The
                sparks cease when the metal In my hand touches the wire. My arm is now traversed by
                a powerful electric current, vibrating at the rate of one million times a second.
                All around me the electrostatic force makes itself felt, and the air molecules and
                particles of dust flying about are acted upon and are hammering violently against my
                body. So great is the agitation of the particles that when the lights are turned out
                you may see streams of feeble light appear on some parts of my body. “I can make
                these streams of light visible to all by touching with the metallic object one of
                the terminals as before, and approaching my free band to the brass sphere which is
                connected to the other terminal of the coil. As the hand is approached, the air
                between it and the sphere, or in the immediate neighborhood, is more violently
                agitated, and you see streams of light break forth from my finger tips and from the
                whole band."</p>

            <p>Copy Editor: Allyson Hall</p>
            <p>At the hearing yesterday on the complaint of John F. Hylan, made when he was Mayor,
                that rates for electric current charged by the Edison companies were too high,
                Public Service <span class="persName">Commissioner Pooley</span> announced that
                    <span class="persName">Matthew S. Sloan</span>, president of the <span
                    class="loc">New York</span>
                <span class="company">Edison Company</span>, had been asked to testify when the
                hearing is resumed next Tuesday. At the hearings by the Public Service Commission on
                submetering <span class="persName">Mr. Sloan</span> testified that if the profits
                made by the submeter concerns had not been diverted from the electric companies it
                would have been possible to reduce the rates.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="persName">Commissioner Pooley</span>, it was explained, wants to learn
                the policy of the <span class="company">Edison Company</span> concerning the
                extension or discontinuance of the <span class="current">direct current</span>
                system. The commission contends that this system is more costly to operate and
                maintain than the more modern system of <span class="current">alternating
                    current</span>. It was suggested that it might be possible to obtain a reduction
                in the rates for electric current if the company adopted the most economical methods
                of operation.</p>
            <p>Reports were submitted to show that the return on the investment of the company will
                yield only a little more than 4 per cent this year, instead of the 8 per cent
                allowed by law. This report was submitted by <span class="persName">Henry M.
                    Edwards</span>, vice president of the company on charge of accounting.</p>
            <p>According to this estimate, the total value of the company's investment will amount
                to $469,474,730.19 by the end of the year. This indicates that the value has almost
                doubled since July 1, 1924. At that time <span class="persName">Dr. William
                    McClellan</span>, on behalf of the commission, submitted an estimate showing
                that the value was $245,574,784.66, which was about $100,000,000 lower that the
                company's estimate.</p>

            <p>Declaring that <span class="current">alternating current</span> was less expensive to
                produce than <span class="current">direct current</span>, <span class="persName"
                    >Otto M. Rau</span>, consulting engineer of <span class="loc"
                    >Philadelphia</span>, who testified yesterday for the city before the Public
                Service Commission in the case started five years ago by the city to bring about a
                reduction in the <span class="loc">New York</span>
                <span class="company">Edison Company's</span> rates, proposed that the company
                replace its <span class="current">direct current</span> equipment with <span
                    class="current">alternating current</span> plants throughout the city. Replying
                to <span class="persName">Mr. Rau's</span> proposal, <span class="persName">Jacob H,
                    Goetz</span>, counsel for the <span class="company">Edison Company</span>,
                characterized the <span class="persName">Rau</span> plan as "the most far-reaching
                effort to scrap a system of properties ever heard in a rate case." The whole theory
                of the substitute plant, he said, had been ruled against by the United States
                Supreme Court in the <span class="loc">Indianapolis</span> water case before <span
                    class="persName">Justice Butler</span>. "To recognize any such testimony on such
                a flimsy basis would make any decision of the commission vulnerable," <span
                    class="persName">Mr. Goetz</span> said. <span class="persName">Commissioner
                    William R. Pooley</span>, hearing the case, agreed with <span class="persName"
                    >Mr. Goetz</span> with the reminder that "we are dealing with a plant as it now
                exists and not with a hypothetical plant." The admissibility of testimony of <span
                    class="persName">Malcolm F. Orton</span>, accountant, on the valuation of the
                    <span class="loc">New York</span>
                <span class="company">Edison Company</span> from documentary analyses of accounts
                dating back to 1901 was questioned by <span class="persName">Mr. Goetz</span> on the
                ground that the figures were too remote and therefore not proper elements in
                determining the present cost of service. He agreed to the admission of the records
                but reserved the right to contest certain portions later when he has checked the
                sources of testimony. Challenges 1901 Valuation.</p>
            <p>The city, according to <span class="persName">Assistant Corporation Counsel Joseph P.
                    Morrissey</span>, challenges the company's figure of $79,000,000 as of <span
                    class="date">May 1, 1901</span>, as representing the actual cost of the property
                that went into the merger of a group of smaller utility companies at that time. The
                actual cost of property that went into the figure, <span class="persName">Mr.
                    Morrissey</span> said, was $23,000,000 about $60,000,000 being "water." The
                retirement of property in existence prior to 1901, he said, he was $4,000,000, or 5
                per cent, while the property retired since that time runs to 40 or 50 per cent. "The
                financial history of the company," <span class="persName">Mr. Morrissey</span> told
                    <span class="persName">Commissioner Pooley</span>, "is peculiarly materials in
                the case because the company is claiming a 'going value.' The courts have said in
                many cases that the financial history of the company should be taken into
                consideration in any determination of 'going value.' We contend that the actual cost
                of the property at present owned by the utility and used in utility service is an
                element that must be considered in fixing fair value." <span class="persName">Mr.
                    Morrissey</span> declared that the United States Supreme Court had ruled in a
                large number of cases that testimony concerning was relavant and proper material for
                consideration in fixing rates. Puts "$12,000,000 Plant" at $1,250,000.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="persName">Mr. Rau</span> presented figures to show that the capital
                investment to produce the amount of current now generated at the company's <span
                    class="loc">Duane Street</span> plant would not excede $1,250,000. According to
                the company's figures, he said, the plant was valued at $12,000,000. <span
                    class="persName">Mr. Rau's</span> testimony brought out that about 90 per cent
                of the generating plant had been dismantled. <span class="persName">Jacob H.
                    Goetz</span>, counsel for the company, explained that plants of the <span
                    class="loc">Brooklyn</span>
                <span class="company">Edison Company</span> now furnished the power once supplied by
                the <span class="loc">Duane Street</span> plant. <span class="persName">Mr.
                    Morrissey</span> recalled that an antiquated generator used in the <span
                    class="loc">Duane Street</span> plant had been sent to the <span class="loc"
                    >Ford Museum</span>, and asked if the company had included the "museum
                valuation" of such property in arriving at the valuation of the <span class="loc"
                    >Duane Street</span> plant. <span class="persName">Mr. Rau's</span> report of
                the valuation of the <span class="loc">Duane Street</span> plant had been ruled out
                at a previous hearing by <span class="persName">Chairman Prendergast</span> because
                the witness said it was a brief. <span class="persName">Mr. Morrissey</span>
                declared that the witness did not think it was a brief in the legal sense but an
                engineer's report which should have been allowed to remain as the opinion of an
                expert. <span class="persName">Commissioner Pooley</span> reserved decision but
                allowed its admission as <span class="persName">Mr. Rau's</span> direct testimony.
                The hearing was adjourned until Feb. 5 at 10:30 A. M.</p>

            <h2 class="h2outline">ALTERNATE CURRENT ELECTRO-STATIC INDUCTION APPARATUS</h2>
            <p>Author: Nikola Tesla</p>
            <p>Encoder(s): Aaron Newton</p>
            <p>Transcriber(s): Allyson Hall</p>
            <p>About a year and a half ago while engaged in the study of <span class="current"
                    >alternate currents</span> of short period, it occurred to me that such currents
                could be obtained by rotating charged surfaces in close proximity to conductors.
                Accordingly I devised various forms of experimental apparatus of which two are
                illustrated in the accompanying engravings. </p>
            <p>Fig. 1. <span class="persName">Tesla</span> Alternating Electrostatic Induction
                Apparatus In the apparatus shown in Fig. 1, A is a ring of dry shellacked hard wood
                provided on its inside with two sets of tin-foil coatings, a and b, all the a
                coatings and all the b coatings being connected together, respectively, but
                independent from each other. These two sets of coatings are connected to two
                terminals, T. For the sake of clearness only a few coatings are shown. Inside of the
                ring A, and in close proximity to it there is arranged to rotate a cylinder B,
                likewise of dry, shellacked hard wood, and provided with two similar sets of
                coatings, a1 and b1, all the coatings a1 being connected to one ring and all the
                others, b1, to another marked + and . These two sets, a1 and b1 are charged to a
                high potential by a Holtz or a Wimshurst machine, and may be connected to a jar of
                some capacity. The inside of ring A is coated with mica in order to increase the
                induction and also to allow higher potentials to be used.</p>
            <p>Fig. 2. <span class="persName">Tesla</span> Alternating Electrostatic Induction
                Apparatus When the cylinder B with the charged coatings is rotated, a circuit
                connected to the terminals T is traversed by <span class="current">alternating
                    currents</span>. Another form of apparatus is illustrated in Fig. 2. In this
                apparatus the two sets of tin-foil coatings are glued on a plate of ebonite, and a
                similar plate which is rotated, and the coatings of which are charged as in Fig. 1,
                is provided.</p>
            <p>The output of such an apparatus is very small, but some of the effects peculiar to
                    <span class="current">alternating currents</span> of short periods may be
                observed. The effects, however, cannot be compared with those obtainable with an
                induction coil which is operated by an <span class="current">alternate
                    current</span> machine of high frequency, some of which were described by me a
                short while ago.</p>

                    class="company">Westinghouse Electric Company</span>, in a letter to the
                Railroad Gazette of last week warns the public of the destructive effect of loose
                electric currents on all underground metallic work such as is employed in the Subway
                and in the <span class="loc">New York Central</span> and <span class="loc"
                    >Pennsylvania</span> tunnel improvements and on the city gas and water
                pipes.</p>
            <p>"It has been shown fully and completely," he says, "that the <span class="current"
                    >direct current</span> is working all of the time in the destruction of some of
                the metallic structures, especially water and gas pipes, adjacent to electric
                conductors, which metallic structures invariably act as conductors for some of the
                currentescaping from the uninsulated rails forming part of the electric circuit in
                railroad operations."</p>
            <p>He shows photographs of water pipes destroyed by electrolytic action from <span
                    class="current">direct current</span> circuits such as is carried by the third
                rail in use in the subway and on the upper railroad about to be installed in the
                    <span class="loc">Park Avenue tunnel</span>, and contends that the steel
                structural part of the <span class="loc">New York City Subway</span> will be so
                destroyed unless the <span class="current">alternating current</span> is used, which
                he says has practically no destructive effect on metal pipes and structural
                steel.</p>
            <p>In the same number of The Railroad Gazette he makes public certain correspondence
                with <span class="persName">President Newman</span> of the <span class="loc">New

                economically possible only where the <span class="current">alternating
                    current</span> is used, and he believes that in the few substitutions so far
                made of <span class="current">direct current</span>, third-rail electric motors for
                steam locomotives, the work will need to be done over again.</p>

                issue of the Electrical Review, of <span class="loc">New York</span>, contains the
                first elaborate description published of experiments carried on in <span
                    class="persName">Nikola Tesla's</span> laboratory, demonstrating his recently
                announced discoveries in the application of electricity to commercial purposes
                without the use of conducting wires.</p>
            <p>The experiments involve handling currents up to 8,000,000 volts, produced by his
                perfect oscillators, with entire safety. Photographs of the experiments actually
                performed make it appear that not only can the energy be transmitted in this manner,
                but also directed to any point desired, regardless of distance and environment.</p>
            <p>In one illustration the inventor recieves the electrical waves from a distance and
                develops a pressure of half a million volts in a coil, which he holds in his hand,
                preserving himself against injury by maintaining a fixed position on the electrical
                wave, where the pressure developed is small. Another photograph shows an assistant
                recieving in his body the curents from an electrical oscillator, which pass through
                his body and make a metar bar glow in his hands, also lighting a vaccuum tube on the
                ceiling.</p>

            <p>The <span class="company">East River Electric Lighting Company</span>, at its dynamo:
                house, <span class="loc">East 24th St.</span>, this city, employs the
                Thomson-Houston system of electric lighting, using in all its outside lamps the
                    <span class="current">direct current</span>. But in the dynamo room is one
                machine which generates the <span class="current">alternating current</span>, and
                this is used to supply the incandescent lights in the building, and, recently, for
                experiments by the <span class="company">Perry Motor Company</span>. This one
                machine generates 1,000 volts power, and has not been long in the building.</p>
            <p>On <span class="date">September 2</span>, says the N.Y. Times, something went wrong
                with the switchboard connected with this machine, and <span class="persName">Darwin
                    A. Henry</span>, the superintendent of construction of the company, undertook to
                set it right. He climbed up the short ladder used to reach the switchboard, and
                started in on his work. He had been thus engaged for about five minutes when he
                attempted to turn part way around on the ladder. In some way one of his feet
                slipped, and for an instant he was in danger of losing his balance. Instinctively
                his arms were thrown up to recover himself. One hand came in contact with the
                negative terminal on the board, and hardly had he touched it when the other had
                struck the positive pole. The effect was instantaneous. The unfortunate man’s hands
                remained as if glued to the death-dealing wire, his head dropped over on one
                shoulder, and in that position he remained for some moments. He did not utter sound.
                There were two other men, named <span class="persName">Thomason</span> and <span
                    class="persName">Smith</span>, working in the room, and one of them after a few
                seconds caught sight of his chief resting apparently with his weight against the
                switchboard. Both men rushed to his assistance, but the man was dead. They tore his
                hands from the wires and lifted his body down and laid it on a bench. One of his
                hands—the right one---was terribly burned, the flesh having been consumed to the
                bone. The other hand was burned, but not so very badly.</p>
            <p>Medical help was at once summoned. <span class="persName">Dr. L.D. Henderson</span>
                and <span class="persName">Dr. W.C. Feeley</span> were at the superintendent’s side
                within ten minutes, and worked hard in trying to restore animation, but they might
                as well have tried to put life in a stone. They injected, hypodermically, quantities
                of brandy. <span class="persName">Sylvester’s</span> system of artificial
                respiration was called into use, and they tried with a galvanic battery to bring the
                man back from death. But all efforts were absolutely useless, and after two hours of
                hard work the weary physicians were obliged to abandon their task and declare their
                patient dead.</p>
            <p>There had not been a single evidence of life in <span class="persName">Henry</span>
                from the time he touched the wires. When the doctors reached him, the heart had
                ceased to beat and there was no sign of respiration.</p>
            <p>In the opinion of both physicians, <span class="persName">Henry</span>’s death was
                instantaneous, and, if the absence of any contortion either in body or face proved
                anything, it was a painless one. The burns in the hand, both the physicians and the
                employees in the building believe, were caused when the hands were torn away from
                the wires and after the man was dead. The separation created an arc, and without an
                arc there can be no burns.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="persName">Mr. Henry</span> was about thirty years old, unmarried, and
                had been a practical electrical engineer from his boyhood. He was a capable
                electrician, and had much experience in handling electric apparatus, and was highly
                regarded by his employers.</p>
            <p>The final argument on the question of the constitutionality of the new electric
                execution law, a question which involves the disputed power of the <span
                    class="current">alternating current</span> to kill, will be held at <span
                    class="loc">Buffalo</span> within a fortnight, and this case may have
                considerable weight in the argument. It is proposed to use an <span class="current"
                    >alternating current</span> of from 1,500 to 2,000 voltage in these executions,
                and it is contended that that force would not be sufficient to kill. In this case a
                1,000 volt current, even when only accidentally applied, did its awful work
                effectually.</p>

            <p>The problem of obtaining continuous currents from <span class="current"
                    >alternating</span> is one that has received not a little attention, and various
                solutions have been offered on both sides of <span class="loc">the Atlantic</span>.
                The <span class="loc">New York</span> correspondent of the Electrician says that
                    <span class="persName">Mr. Nikola Tesla</span> has applied himself to the
                matter, and now offers a simple and ingenious solution. His idea and method consist
                broadly in directing the waves of an <span class="current">alternating
                    current</span> so as to produce continuous currents by developing in the
                branches of an <span class="current">alternating-current</span> circuit certain
                manifestations of energy or active opposite resistances by which the <span
                    class="current">alternating-current</span> waves of opposite sign are diverted
                through different circuits. Thus the currents of different sign are, so to speak,
                sifted out: those of one sign passing over one branch, and those of an opposite sign
                over the other. There may thus be obtained from an <span class="current">alternating
                    current</span> two or more <span class="current">direct currents</span> without
                the employment of a commutator. <span class="persName">Mr. Tesla</span> proposes
                both electrical and electro-magnetic methods for achieving this result. In the
                electrical method the device to create an electromotive force counter to the waves
                of current on one side may, for example, be batteries or continuous-current
                machines. In the electro-magnetic method, instead of producing the electromotive
                force in each branch of the circuit, a field of force may be established, and the
                branches be led through it in such a manner that an active opposition will be
                developed therein by the passage, or tendency to pass, of the <span class="current"
                    >alternations of current</span>. Another purely magnetic method is that wherein
                    <span class="persName">Mr. Tesla</span> employs two strong permanent magnets,
                the armatures of which are built up of thin laminae of soft iron or steel, the
                amount of magnetic metal which they contain being so calculated that they will be
                nearly or fully saturated by the magnets.</p>

                <span class="persName">Mr. Nikola Tesla</span>, to whom the English and French
                scientific public has just accorded a very warm reception, is a pioneer in electric
                science, and one of those who will have influenced future progress through an almost
                radical transformation of the old processes and old methods.</p>
            <p>Some day we shall have occasion to describe the two <span class="current">alternating
                    current</span> motors devised by <span class="persName">Mr. Tesla</span> as long
                ago as 1888. At present, we shall content ourselves with recurring to his
                magnificent experiments on high potentials and <span class="current">alternating
                    currents</span> of great frequency, of which we have already given a complete
                idea in summarizing the communication made by the author on the <span class="date"
                    >30th of May, 1891</span>, before the American Institute of Electrical
                Engineers.</p>
            <p>In the train of this communication, which made a very great sensation in the
                scientific world, <span class="persName">Mr. Tesla</span>, acceding to the pressing
                solicitations of his friends and admirers, came to <span class="loc">Europe</span>
                and performed at <span class="loc">London</span> on February 3rd, and at Paris on
                the 19th of the same month, before the French Society of Physics and the
                International Society of Electricians, assembled in the hall of the Society of
                Encouragement, the remarkable experiments of which we were witness and of which we
                propose to give an idea, despite the dryness of the subject, its very special
                character, and our inability to make a clear exposition of it.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="persName">Mr. Tesla</span> did not content himself with a simple
                repetition of the experiments made in <span class="loc">America</span>, but he
                extended them and rendered them complete, and the communications made in <span
                    class="loc">Europe</span> may be considered as the second part of a long and
                remarkable study of which the first part was presented in the New World last
                year.</p>
            <p>In the first place, let us briefly recall the processes employed by <span
                    class="persName">Mr. Tesla</span> for the production of <span class="current"
                    >alternating currents</span> of great frequency. The simplest consists in the
                use of an alternator of special form, which is represented herewith in Fig. 2. This
                consists of a steel disk 30 inches in diameter, upon which are mounted 384 small
                bobbins, or, more accurately, 384 small zigzag windings. This disk revolves in the
                interior of a fixed ring carrying 384 inductor poles. The result is that the
                frequency of the <span class="current">alternating currents</span> engendered by the
                revolution of the armature before the inductors produces 193 periods per revolution,
                and that at the normal maximum velocity of 3,000 revolutions per minute, or 30 per
                second, a frequency of 9,600 periods per second is obtained, instead of the hundred
                solely that ordinary alternators give. The <span class="current">alternating
                    current</span> thus engendered is collected through the aid of two rings against
                which two brushes rub, as in all alternators with movable armature.</p>
            <p>A separate excitation permits of varying at will the alternator’s electro-motive
                force, which, under full excitation, may reach 300 volts. In the second process
                employed by <span class="persName">Mr. Tesla</span> for obtaining much greater
                frequencies, which may reach and even exceed a million per second, he utilizes an
                ordinary alternator. In the experiments of February 19, he employed a <span
                    class="company">Siemens</span> alternator, whose frequency did not exceed fifty
                periods per second.</p>
            <p>The <span class="current">alternating current</span> thus produced is sent to an
                induction coil by establishing in derivation, upon the primary circuit, a disruptive
                discharge apparatus formed of a condenser and two polished bans whose distance apart
                may be varied This spacing regulates the frequency of the discharges, and,
                consequently, the frequency of the currents traversing the inductor of the bobbin.
                The sparks of the disruptive discharges burst forth in a powerful magnetic, field
                which facilitates their rapid production, as well as the cooling of the space
                wherein they are produced with so great a rapidity. Whatever be the process employed
                for obtaining great frequencies, the potential is always inadequate, and it is
                increased by transforming the <span class="current">alternating current</span> by
                the aid of a suitable bobbin. This latter consists of an internal inductor winding
                and an external armature winding, formed of relatively coarse wire, and of a number
                of quite small spirals; for it must not be lost sight of that, seeing the great
                frequency of the currents, the electromotive force developed for a given length of
                wire is incomparably higher than with ordinary bobbins. These bobbins have no iron
                core, and are completely submerged in boiled linseed oil; the object of which is to
                secure perfect insulation and to prevent the presence of air, which, in this
                particular case, would be very prejudicial through the considerable heating that it
                would produce under the action of the enormous and frequently reversed electrostatic
                tensions to which it would be submitted.</p>
            <p>In order to obtain powerful effects, <span class="persName">Mr. Tesla</span>
                overcomes the prejudicial effects of self-induction by utilizing the properties of
                condensers properly interposed in the circuit of the alternator or in derivation
                upon the terminals of the disruptive discharge apparatus. A certain number of the
                experiments made by <span class="persName">Mr. Tesla</span> on Feb. 19 were merely a
                reproduction of those that we have spoken of before. We shall therefore not
                reproduce them, but shall dwell more especially upon those that present a character
                of novelty.</p> Fig. 2, TESLA’S RAPID ALTERNATOR. <p>The first experiments were made
                with the disruptive discharge apparatus, that which gives the greatest frequencies
                at present obtainable by tho means at our disposal. In these conditions, the
                electrostatic discharges traverse the air under the form of luminous discharges, as
                if the air were rarefied. On interposing an ebonite plate, the electrostatic
                capacity of the system formed by the two balls between which the discharge takes
                place and the ebonite plate is increased by the interposition of a dielectric whose
                specific inductive capacity is greater than that of the air, and the brightness of
                the discharges is thereby intensified. These discharges easily traverse long tubes
                containing rarefied gases, which they illuminate with a bright light, each rarefied
                gas giving to the light its own distinctive color. The discharges occur likewise
                between two cotton-covered wires insulated from each other and put in connection
                with the two terminals of tho bobbin. These wires emit a violet light throughout
                their entire length, and even render luminous the space comprised between them.</p>
            Kg. 1,—PARIS-MR. TESLA LECTURING BEFORE THE FRENCH PHYSICAL SOCIETY AND THE
            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF ELECTRICIANS. <p>All the other experiments were made with the
                alternator shown in Fig. 3, which gives from 9,000 to 10,000 periods per second.
                    <span class="persName">Mr. Tesla</span> first showed the discharges in the form
                of a flame.</p>
            <p>In order to prove that these discharges of high potential and great frequency are not
                dangerous, he was able, on taking in his hands two metallic balls designed to
                prevent his being burned by the spark, to receive the entire discharge from the
                bobbin, the discharge passing through his body interposed between the two balls.
                    <span class="persName">Mr. Tesla</span> afterward showed that the return wire is
                absolutely useless for making the discharge current pass. The latter may be
                established by the air, and pass more easily if care be taken to connect one of the
                extremities of the wire of the bobbin with a conducting plate insulated in space.
                The molecular bombardment heats the part which presents but little surface put in
                communication with the second pole of the bobbin, and it was thus that <span
                    class="persName">Mr. Tesla</span> showed us the incandescence of a thin platinum
                wire or of a carbon filament inclosed in a globe of rarefied air.</p>
            <p>Every increase in the capacity of the system increases the discharge current, and,
                consequently, the incandescence. It suffices, for example, to bring the hand near
                the globe containing the incandescent body, and to place a metallic shade above the
                latter, or even (an effect paradoxical in appearance) to place the shade alongside
                of the globe, to produce an increase of brightness resulting from the increase of
                the electrostatic capacity.</p>
            <p>The wire to which the filament is attached is connected, sis we have said, with the
                secondary wire of the bobbin, whose other wire communicates with an insulated
                metallic plate. Such metallic communication is not indispensable. In fact, if the
                wire is covered with lead, a layer of gutta peroha entirely insulating the copper
                wire and the leaden tube that envelops it, the lamp with a single filament becomes
                lighted as brilliantly when it is put in communication with the copper wire or the
                leaden tube.</p>
            <p>
                <span class="persName">Mr. Tesla</span> thus actuated a Crookes electric radiator,
                and even a special single wire motor, to describe which would lead us too far. He
                afterward illuminated certain bodies that are but mediocre conductors, such as
                alumina, carbon, lime, “carborundum,” and a few phosphorescent bodies, such as
                sulphide of calcium, yttria, sulphide of zinc, and the ruby, the marvelous effects
                of which several times gained the unanimous applause of the spectators. <span
                    class="persName">Mr. Tesla</span> finally terminated with a few experiments in
                the illumination of tubes of rarefied gases without wires or electrodes, the tubes
                being simply placed in the periodical electrostatic field produced between one of
                the insulated poles of the bobbin on the one hand and an insulated metallic plate
                placed above the experimenter and communicating with the other pole of the bobbin on
                the other hand.</p>
            <p>Fig. 1 shows one of these experiments, in which <span class="persName">Mr.
                    Tesla</span> is producing the illumination of two tubes at once. In order to
                effect the extinction of one of these tubes, it suffices to interpose a middlingly
                conductive screeh in the electrostatic field, or to place the tube in a direction
                sensibly perpendicular to the flux of induction of the field. The same tube remains
                dark in all positions if it is held by its two extremities at once, the body forming
                a screen. On sliding the hand along the tube, it is possible to render one of its'
                extremities luminous. Nothing is more curious than to see the light produced by this
                process thus extinguished and relighted at will.</p>
            <p>Such are, very briefly described, the principal experiments which, for more than two
                hours, deeply interested the members of the two societies mentioned above, who had
                the good fortune to be present at <span class="persName">Mr. Tesla’s</span>
                lecture.</p>
            <p>It would be difficult as yet to say what future is in store for them from the
                standpoint of an industrial, utilitarian and practical new mode of production of
                light. The more so as the dream of the inventor is broader and his views more
                exalted than the expert-ments that he presented to us allow to be seen. His final
                ambition appears to be to transform the energy of the medium that environs us, and
                which is very evident by its numerous manifestations, into light, or at least to
                obtain therefrom radiations of the same wave length and same frequency as those that
                produce luminous sensations. Crookes’ radiometer has already proved that it is
                possible to convert the radiant energy of a medium directly into mechanical energy,
                and although, from the standpoint of rendering, this radiometer is the most
                detestable of all transformation apparatus, it is none the less the most admirable,
                by the fact that it affords us a tangible demonstration of the possibility of such
                transformation.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, <span class="persName">Mr. Tesla</span>, in his memorable
                experiments, has shown us that, on periodically varying, with very great frequency,
                an electrostatic field, it is possible to place apparatus of great simplicity
                therein, such as tubes of rarefied gases, which collect a portion of such energy and
                render it luminous. To the philosopher and savant nothing more is necessary to
                establish the possibility, if not the probability, of the realization of <span
                    class="persName">Mr. Tesla’s</span> final views. To him the light of the future
                resides in the incandescence of solids, gases, and phosphorescent bodies excited (if
                we may use a somewhat vague expression) by high potentials varying with very great
                frequency.</p>
            <p>The young scientist is convinced of this as a precursor, and almost as a prophet. He
                introduces so much warmth and sincerity into his explanations and experiments that
                faith wins us, and, despite ourselves, we believe that we are witnesses of the dawn
                of a nearby revolution in the present processes of illumination. —B. Hospitaller, in

            <p>Encoder(s): Allyson Hall</p>
            <p>Transcriber(s): Allyson Hall</p>
            <p>Copy Editor: Allyson Hall</p>
            <p>The interest taken in <span class="persName">Mr. Tesla's</span> contributions to
                electrical apparatus and to electrical literature is so great, and the subject is so
                important, that we do not hesitate to give further space to the subject. On <span
                    class="date">May 26</span> a communication on the subject from <span
                    class="persName">Dr. Louis Duncan</span>, of Johns Hopkins University, appeared
                in our American contemporary, the Electrical Review, to the effect:</p>
            <p>"We may, for our present purposes, divide motors into two classes; Continuous, in
                which the armature coils are unsymmetrical with respect to the poles, and which,
                therefore, give a practically constant torque, and alternating motors, in which the
                armature coils are symmetrical with respect to the poles, and which, therefore, give
                a torque varying both in magnitude and sign during a period of the counter E.M.F.
                The <span class="persName">Tesla</span> motor belongs to this latter class.</p>
            <p>"In every motor the torque is equal to the rate of change of lines of induction
                through the armature circuit for a small angular displacement, multiplied by the
                armature current, or dm/dt.</p>
            <p>In the <span class="persName">Tesla</span> motor the first of these terms is greatest
                when the coil is opposite a pole and the field currents have their greatest
                amplitude. It is zero at a point about 45 deg. from this, supposing we neglect
                armature reactions. It depends on several things. The E.M.F. which determines it is
                due to changes in the number of lines of force passing through the armature circuit
                caused by (1) changes in the field currents; (2) the motion of the armature. The
                current depends on these E.M.F.'s, and on the reduced self-induction and resistance
                of its circuit. The motor can only do work when the first cause of E.M.F. is the
                greater, for a current in the direction of the ordinary counter E.M.F. would stop
                the motion. In some parts of a revolution the two E.M.F.'s work together, retarding
                the motion; in others, the induced E.M.F. produces a current causing the motor to
                revolve. It is impossible for me, with only a meagre description of the principles
                of the machine, to give an idea of the relative magnitude of these effects. Some of
                the results, however, are the following: Having given a definite number of reversals
                of the dynamo, there are a number of speeds, multiples of these reversals, at which
                the motor will govern itself when it is doing a certain amount of work. At one of
                these speeds, depending on the construction of the motor, the output will be a
                maximum. Now I see the statement that 'there is no difficulty whatever attendant
                upon starting the motor under load.' I cannot reconcile this with the above facts.
                That the torque for a smaller number of revolutions than ordinarily used, might be
                greater, one can readily see, since the counter E.M.F. is less in proportion to the
                induced E.M.F., but it must be remembered that for certain speeds even the induced
                current would tend to stop the motion; how the motor is to pass these critical
                speeds I do not see. Again, if the maximum load is suddenly thrown on while the
                motor is running at its proper speed, then, if the inertia be great, the motor will
                fall behind its point of maximum work, and either stop or take up some slower
                speed.</p>
            <p>"What the possible efficiency and output of the motor may be, only experiment will
                tell. I have shown (Inst. Elec. Engineers, Feb., 1888.) that the output of an
                ordinary <span class="current">alternating current</span> motor is equal to that of
                a continuous current motor, supplied with a corresponding ing E.M.F. The efficiency
                might be great, but is has the disadvantage that about the same current flows for no
                work and maximum work, so for light loads the efficiency can hardly be very
                high.</p>
            <p>"With our present knowledge of <span class="current">alternating currents</span> it
                is useless to attempt to calculate from the simple though misleading assumptions
                ordinarily made, the output, conditions of maximum work &amp; of this machine.
                Experiment alone can determine its value, and one properly conducted and interpreted
                set of experiments should enable us to judge both the merit of the invention and its
                best possible form. I cannot see, however, how, in the form described in the last
                issue of this journal the motor can work under conditions of a suddenly varying load
                as satisfactorily as continuous current motors."</p>
            <p>To the above <span class="persName">Mr. Tesla</span> replied on <span class="date"
                    >June 2</span> as follows:</p>
            <p>"I find in your issue of last week a note of <span class="persName">Mr. Duncan</span>
                referring to my system of <span class="current">alternate current</span> motors.
                "</p>
            <p>As I see that <span class="persName">Dr. Duncan</span> has not as yet been made
                acquainted with the real character of my invention, I cannot consider his article in
                the light of a serious criticism, and would think it unnecessary to respond; but
                desiring to express my consideration for him and the importance which I attach to
                his opinion, I will point out here briefly the characteristic features of my
                invention, inasmuch as they have a direct bearing on the article above referred
                to.</p>
            <p>"The principle of action of my motor will be well understood from the following: By
                passing <span class="current">alternate currents</span> in proper manner through
                independent evergising circuits in the motor, a progressive shifting or rotation of
                the poles of the same is effected. This shifting is more or less continuous
                according to the construction of the motor and the character and relative phase of
                the currents which should exist in order to secure the most perfect action.</p>
            <p>"If a laminated ring be wound with four coils, and the same be connected in proper
                order to two independent circuits of an <span class="current">alternate
                    current</span> generator adapted for this purpose, the passage of the currents
                through the coils produces theoretically a rotation of the poles of the ring, and in
                actual practice, in a series of experiments, I have demonstrated the complete
                analogy between such a ring and a revolving magnet. From the application of this
                principle to the operation of motors, two forms of motor of a character widely
                differing have resulted — one designed for constant and the other for variable load.
                The misunderstanding of <span class="persName">Dr. Duncan</span> is due to the fact
                that the prominent features of each of these two forms have not been specifically
                stated. In illustration of a representative of the second class, I refer to Fig. 1,
                given herewith. In this instance, the armature of the motor is provided with two
                coils at right angles. As it may be believed that a symmetrical arrangement of the
                coils with respect to the poles is required, I will assume that the armature is
                provided with a great number of diametrically wound coils or conductors closed upon
                themselves, and forming as many independent circuits. Let it now be supposed that
                the ring is permanently magnetized so as to show two poles (N and S) at two points
                diametrically opposite, and that it is rotated by mechanical power. The armature
                being stationary, the rotation of the ring magnet will set up currents in the closed
                armature coils. These currents will be most intense at or near the points of the
                greatest density of the force, and they will produce poles upon the armature core at
                right angles to those of the ring. Of course there will be other elements entering
                into action which will tend to modify this, but for the present they may be left
                unconsidered. As far as the location of the poles upon the armature core is
                concerned, the currents generated in the armature coils will always act in the same
                manner, and will maintain continuously the poles of the core in the same position,
                with respect to those of the ring in any position of the latter, and independently
                of the speed. From the attraction between the core and the ring, a continuous rotary
                effort, constant in all positions, will result, the same as in a continuous current
                motor with a great number of armature coils. If the armature be allowed to turn, it
                will revolve in the direction of rotation of the ring magnet, the induced current
                diminishing as the speed increases, until upon the armature reaching very nearly the
                speed of the magnet, just enough current will flow through the coils to keep up the
                rotation. If, instead of rotating the ring by mechanical power, the poles of the
                same are shifted by the action of the <span class="current">alternate
                    currents</span> in the two circuits, the same results are obtained.</p>
            <p>"Now compare this system with a continuous current system. In the latter we have
                    <span class="current">alternate currents</span> in the generator and motor
                coils, and intervening devices for commutating the currents, which on the motor
                besides effect automatically a progressive shifting or rotation of the poles of the
                armature; here we have the same elements and identically the same operation, but
                without the commutating devices. In view of the fact that these devices are entirely
                unessential to the operation, such <span class="current">alternate current</span>
                system will — at least in many respects — show a complete similarity with a
                continuous current system, and the motor will act precisely like a continuous
                current motor. If the load is augmented, the speed is diminished and the rotary
                effort correspondingly increased, as more current is made to pass through the
                energising circuits; load being taken off, the speed increases, and the current, and
                consequently the effort, is lessened. The effort, of course, is greatest when the
                armature is in the state of rest.</p>
            <p>"But, since the analogy is complete, how about the maximum efficiency and current
                passing through the circuits when the motor is running without any load? one will
                naturally inquire. It must be remembered that we have to deal with <span
                    class="current">alternate currents</span>. In this form the motor simply
                represents a transformer, in which currents are induced by a dynamic action instead
                of by reversals, and, as it might be expected, the efficiency will be maximum at
                full load. As regards the current, there will be — at least, under proper conditions
                — as wide a variation in its strength as in a transformer, and, by observing proper
                rules, it may be reduced to any desired quantity. Moreover, the current passing
                through the motor when running free, is no measure for the energy absorbed, since
                the instruments indicate only the numerical sum of the <span class="current"
                    >direct</span> and induced electromotive forces and currents instead of showing
                their difference.</p>
            <p>"Regarding the other class of these motors, designed for constant speed, the
                objections of <span class="persName">Dr. Duncan</span> are, in a measure applicable
                to certain constructions, but it should be considered that such motors are not
                expected to run without any, or with a very light load; and, if so, they do not,
                when properly constructed, present in this respect any more disadvantage than
                transformers under similar conditions. Besides, both features, rotary effort and
                tendency to constant speed, may be combined in a motor, and any desired
                preponderance may be given to either one, and in this manner a motor may be obtained
                possessing any desired character and capable of satisfying any possible demand in
                practice.</p>
            <p>"In conclusion, I will remark, with all respect to <span class="persName">Dr.
                    Duncan</span>, that the advantages claimed for my system are not mere
                assumptions, but results actually obtained, and that for this purpose experiments
                have been conducted through a long period, and with an assiduity such as only a deep
                interest in the invention could inspire; nevertheless, although my motor is the
                fruit of long labour and careful investigation, I do not wish to claim any other
                merit beyond that of having invented it, and I leave it to men more competent than
                with <span class="current">alternate currents</span>. In this form the motor simply
                represents a transformer, in which currents are induced by a dynamic action instead

                application. What the result of these investigations will be the future will tell;
                but whatever they may be, and to whatever this principle may lead, I shall be
                sufficiently recompensed if later it will be admitted that I have contributed a

            <p>Author: No Author Specified</p>
            <p>Encoder(s): Aaron Newton</p>
            <p>Transcriber(s): Aaron Newton</p>
            <p>Great interest has been aroused in <span class="loc">England</span> by experiments
                now in progress with a method of transmission by high-pressure <span class="current"
                    >direct current</span> instead of by high-pressure <span class="current"
                    >alternating current</span>, details of which are described in the Engineering
                Supplement of The <span class="loc">London</span> Times. The machine employed, which
                is the invention of Highfield and Calverley, is known as a "transverter," and
                consists of a transformer for stepping up the pressure of the three-phase current
                generated by the turbo-alternators and of several rotating commutators for
                converting the <span class="current">alternating current</span> into <span
                    class="current">direct current</span>.</p>
            <p>By connecting these commutators in series, the <span class="current"
                    >direct-current</span> pressure of each is added to that of the one behind it.
                In the experimental transverters which have been working for the last sixteen months
                the pressure is 100,000 volts, but it is thought that this might possibly be
                doubled.</p>
            <p>Assuming, however, that <span class="current">direct-current</span> transmission is
                limited to 100,000 volts, this would more than double the economic railway
                distribution radius, and it is possible that if higher pressures can be used the
                distribution radius to 100 miles. As the machine is reversible, transverters are
                employed at the recieving end to convert the <span class="current">direct
                    current</span> into three-phase or single-phase, or to reduce the <span
                    class="current">direct-current</span> pressure to that require for traction
                purposes.</p>
            <p>The new machine has not yet been tried commercially, but it is understood that
                transverters are being built by the <span class="company">English Electric
                    Company</span> which, it is hoped, will be in commercial service in <span
                    class="loc">London</span> this year.</p>
