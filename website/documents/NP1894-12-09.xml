        <p>Any one of our modern electrical scientists could, by departing from the dignity of his
            calling, launch out as a professional magician and make a fortune on the stage.
                <persName ref="#Tesla">Nikola Tesla</persName>, <persName ref="#Edison"
                >Edison</persName>, <persName ref="#Thomson">Prof. Ellihu Thomson</persName>, and
            many other earnest workers surpass in their laboratory experiments anything done behind
            the footlights. No Hindoo juggler can do more in the gentle art of mystifying than the
            electrician. His apparatus is simple and his results are amusing enough to sound a
            recall. <persName ref="#Edison">Thomas A. Edison</persName> several years ago had a
            small motor which ran without any apparent electrical. connection. It stood upon a table
            and whirled rapidly. It was very mystifying in the then stage of electrical science and
            savored of perpetual motion. The real secret lay in the fact that projecting from the
            base of the motor were two sharp metal pins which, when the motor was laid upon the
            table, penetrated the thin veneer of the table top and made connection with wires
            underneath. An electrician would disdain such a device now. Recent progress has shown
            that it is not necessary to have even the connecting wires. Motors now run and depend
            for their driving power on the electrical excitement of the atmosphere. They may bo far
            removed from the appliance generating the power and yet work away merrily. <persName
                ref="#Tesla">Tesla</persName> will hold a lamp in his band, stand in the middle of a
            largo room away from all wires or metallic connections, and the lamp will glow and send
            forth a radiance not to be equalled. What could be more magical than this?</p>
        <heading>THE SPINNING EGG.</heading>
        <p>Could <persName>Christopher Columbus</persName> have visited the <event>Chicago
                Exposition</event> he would have found his trick of making an egg stand on end very
            much improved by aid of electricity. In one of the exhibits was a large egg on end upon
            a table. Visitors wondered what made that egg stand on end. Then it was discovered that
            the egg was not standing, but whirling—whirling with such rapidity that it seemed to
            stand still. Suddenly the egg stopped moving and fell down upon its side. Now, wonderful
            as this seemed, it is a very simple phenomenon, easily produced, and an everyday
            occurrence in the laboratory. The egg belonged to <persName ref="#Tesla">Nikola
                Tesla</persName>, and is at present in his laboratory in <loc>New York city</loc>.
            Inside the egg were arranged several coils of wire, and these were acted upon by several
            other coils near by, but unconnected by any mechanical process with the egg itself. </p>
        <heading>FREAKS OF THE ALTERNATING ELECTRIC CURRENT.</heading>
        <p>When the <current type="AC">alternating current</current> of electricity, as it is
            called, began to be understood several years ago, it was noticed that very peculiar
            phenomena were attendant on its action. When, for instance, a peculiarly wound coil of
            wire was placed near another coil that was traversed by an <current type="AC"
                >alternating current</current>, a repulsive action took place, and the coils were
            driven away from each other. Under other conditions, attraction resulted. By
            manipulating the coils a series of attractions and repulsions were produced, and thus it
            became possible to get any number of strange effects, one of them being the apparent
            causeless whirling of the egg. Another is the action of a bunch of keys which, when
            thrown upon the table in place of the egg, whirls so rapidly that its form is
            indistinguishable. A copper plate or a copper ring ls affected precisely the same as the
            coll when place near an <current type="AC">alternating current</current> coil. It will
            be driven away or attracted. How easy, then, for the electrician to turn magician and
            mystify an audience. A simple cell underneath a table top will create more mystery for
            the uninitiated than a spiritualistic seance. The intervening wood of the table cuts no
            figure in the general calculation. The <current type="AC">alternating current</current>
            is a great leveler. it cares for nothing. A coil traversed by the current Will create
            all around it an electrical atmosphere that will penetrate wood, glass, or anything else
            of the same nature. <persName ref="#Thomson"> Prof. Elihu Thomson</persName> of
                <loc>Lynn, Mass.</loc>, has performed a number of experiments which show the great
            possibilities for amusing which may be got out of the <current type="AC">alternating
                current</current>. </p>
        <heading>A MAGICAL HOOP.</heading>
        <p>In the same laboratory they take a metal plate and spin it on a pivot, not by any
            mechanical moans, but by surrounding the plate and pivot with what appears to bo a
            large, hoop attached to a handle. The hoop, however, is really the core of a large,
            electric coil, wire being wrapped round and round it, The repulsion and attraction set
            up in the hoop cause the metal plate to revolve. If the bunch of before mentioned were
            thrown on the table and within this hoop, it would whirl as rapidly as in the first
            instance. So would the egg. <persName ref="#Thomson">Prof. Thomson</persName> has
            described how he has laid a common steel file on a table underneath which a coil was
            fixed, and caused metal discs to revolve in his hands by merely holding the discs near
            to the filo But even this is not as curious as a feat performed in another laboratory
            not long since. A number of metal plates were laid out on a table as though in
            preparation for a dinner party. Then some people were asked to seat themselves at the
            table, and no sooner had they done so than the plates suddenly began to Jump into the
            air. Nothing could have been more startling, and there was a general and instanta neous
            stampede. Then it was disclosed that each plate had been laid directly above where a
            coil was placed under the Following is an idea obtained from the above, one of the
            persons present suggested that church contribution boxes could be made on this plan with
            curious results. Such a box has been made, and is simply impossible to get money to stay
            in it. Pennies especially have no liking for it and fly out in a surprising manner. </p>
        <heading>THE DANCING NAILS.</heading>
        <p>The same principle which governed the above was applied in another direction during an
            exhibition which was given by the <loc>Franklin Institute of Philadelphia</loc> some
            time ago. In the middle of the hall stood a plain pine table and on it was a handful of
            ordinary tenpenny nails. The nails lay in a heap and it looked as though some workman
            had thrown them there. Spectators were busy watching other things and the nails were
            passed with a glance. However, the eyes of one old lady and gentleman nearly popped out
            of their heads when happening to look at the nails, the latter all got up on end, heads
            up, and actually bowed and scraped to the astonished couple. The table was surrounded in
            an instant by astonished people, before whom the nails paired off and danced and
            waltzed. Some fell on their sides but immediately got up and bowed an apology. Coils
            beneath the table did it all. The head of the nails, containing more bulk than the
            points, sustained more repusive action and consefarthest away from the coil, which in
            its turn was regulated from another part of the room. </p>
        <heading><persName ref="#Tesla">NIKOLA TESLA</persName>’S STARTLING EXPERIMENTS.</heading>
        <p>Mr. <persName ref="#Tesla">Tesla</persName>, in the course of a recent evening lecture,
            requested that the lights be turned, off it was done, and then the audience saw truly
            magic sight. There stood the electrician with a small lamp in his hand and his hand
            above his head. Rays of unequaled beauty came from the lamp and spread down over the
            body of the man. The lamp was a simple affair and no wires connecting it with a hidden
            source supply. It was as if the lamp of Aladdin had been rubbed and beautiful jewels
            were gleaming forth, this was followed by another and even more startling experiment.
            Again the room was, darkened. The lecturer became invisible to the expectant spectators
            and then a human hand, plaln and distinct, a hand of fire, reached out from the darkness
            and; all transparent, was seen waving aloft, while shooting out from it were sparks and
            streams of light. In exposition of these seeming wonders let me give Mr. <persName
                ref="#Tesla">Tesla</persName>’s own words: </p>
        <heading>
            <persName ref="#Tesla">TESLA</persName> EXPLAINS THE WONDERS.</heading>
        <p>"When two conducting bodies are insulated and electrified, we say that an electrostatic
            force is acting between them. This force manifests itself in attractions, repulsions and
            stresses in the bodies and space or medium without. So great may be the strain exerted
            in the air that it may break down, and we obeerve sparks of bundles of light or
            streamers, as they are called. These streamers form abundantly when the force through
            the air io rapidly varying. I will illustrate this action in a novel experiment in which
            I will employ an Induction coll. The coll is contained in a trough of oil and is placed
            under the table. The two ends of the. secondary wire of the coil pass, through two
            columns of hard rubber which protrude to some height above the table. Attached to one
            wire running through the hard rubber Is a large sphere of sheet brass. </p>
        <heading>THE FLYING RING.</heading>
        <p>Perhaps the most wonderful trick of all is the one in which the current overcomes the
            force of gravity. A short, stout column of wood stands upon .the laboratory table. Near
            by is a copperring, a trifle larger than the column. Concealed In that column of* wood
            is a coil traversed by an <current type="AC">alternating current</current>. Now, strange
            as it may seem, it is impossible to keep that ring on that column. Place it there and It
            will fly off the moment you take your hands away. Throw it on, it will balance itself in
            midair around the column until the electricity overcomes the force of gravity, and then
            it will fly away as before. The repulsive action lias taken place and forced the ring
            away from, the immediate neighborhood of the concealed coil. The effect is really
            magical. The ring can be made to stay near the coil in one way by taking advantage of
            the attractive faction. You may stand the ring on edge, as it were, on the projecting
            core of such a coll, and the attraction at this point will hold it firmly. </p>
        <heading>A LAMP THAT BURNS ONLY UNDER WATER.</heading>
        <p>It is one of the principles of the <current type="AC">alternating current</current> that
            when a coil is traversed by it, it has the power to induce a current to flow in another
            coil, if the latter is brought within the electric atmosphere of the first coil.
                <persName ref="#Thomson">Prof. Thomson</persName> has taken advantage of this fact
            to produce a very mystifying and very beautiful experiment. You may walk into his
            laboratory some day and behold an incandescent, lamp floating around in a jar of water,
            and connected to a dynamo. You may safely, lift the lamp out of the water and examine
            it. The light will be extinguished immediately, and, if you will examine the lamp, a
            small coil will bo found in the base of it. Put the lamp back into the water, and it
            will immediately relight. Yet there is no substance in the water to cause the
            phenomenon. It is pure water. But there is a coil concealed under the table, traversed
            by a powerful alternating current. By means of it a current is induced in the coil,
            which is secured in the base of the lamp, and the latter is thus lighted. Such an
            affair, used upon the professional stage, would cause the greatest wonderment. The jar
            filled with water is merely used for effect, for if the lamp is taken out of the water
            and laid on the table it will light up just as quickly. Such an exhibition as this ought
            to cause grave forebodings to be experienced throughout the match trade. </p>
        <heading>BALLS AND PLATES SPINNING UNDER WATER.</heading>
        <p>The queerest aquarium in existence, probably, is owned by <persName ref="#Thomson">Prof.
                Thomson</persName>. For it he uses the same jar and water in which the lamp was
            exhibited. His fish are differently shaped and constructed from any that ply the sea. In
            fact, they consist of some small metal balls and a metal plate. Tossed lightly into the
            water they immediately revolve at a speed sufficient to churn up the liquid to a degree.
            They strike each other and careen from side to side at a great rate, and the physical
            action to very instructive and interesting to watch. As in the case of the lamp, the
            water is not necessary. The balls may be laid on the plate on the table and they will
            whirl as fast as did <persName ref="#Tesla">Tesla</persName>'s egg. It is the old story
            of the coil concealed beneath the table. “I now set the coil to work and approach the
            free terminal with a metallic object held in my band, this simply to avoid burns. As I
            approach the metallic object to a distance of eight or ten inches, a torrent of furious
            sparks breaks forth from the end of the secondary wire which passes through the rubber
            column. The sparks cease when the metal In my hand touches the wire. My arm is now
            traversed by a powerful electric current, vibrating at the rate of one million times a
            second. All around me the electrostatic force makes itself felt, and the air molecules
            and particles of dust flying about are acted upon and are hammering violently against my
            body. So great is the agitation of the particles that when the lights are turned out you
            may see streams of feeble light appear on some parts of my body. “I can make these
            streams of light visible to all by touching with the metallic object one of the
            terminals as before, and approaching my free band to the brass sphere which is connected
            to the other terminal of the coil. As the hand is approached, the air between it and the
            sphere, or in the immediate neighborhood, is more violently agitated, and you see
            streams of light break forth from my finger tips and from the whole band."</p>
