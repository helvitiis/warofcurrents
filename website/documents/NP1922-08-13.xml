		<p>Great interest has been aroused in <loc>England</loc> by experiments now in progress with
			a method of transmission by high-pressure <current type="DC">direct current</current>
			instead of by high-pressure <current type="AC">alternating current</current>, details of
			which are described in the Engineering Supplement of The <loc>London</loc> Times. The
			machine employed, which is the invention of Highfield and Calverley, is known as a
			"transverter," and consists of a transformer for stepping up the pressure of the
			three-phase current generated by the turbo-alternators and of several rotating
			commutators for converting the <current type="AC">alternating current</current> into
				<current type="DC">direct current</current>.</p>
		<p>By connecting these commutators in series, the <current type="DC"
				>direct-current</current> pressure of each is added to that of the one behind it. In
			the experimental transverters which have been working for the last sixteen months the
			pressure is 100,000 volts, but it is thought that this might possibly be doubled.</p>
		<p>Assuming, however, that <current type="DC">direct-current</current> transmission is
			limited to 100,000 volts, this would more than double the economic railway distribution
			radius, and it is possible that if higher pressures can be used the distribution radius
			to 100 miles. As the machine is reversible, transverters are employed at the recieving
			end to convert the <current type="DC">direct current</current> into three-phase or
			single-phase, or to reduce the <current type="DC">direct-current</current> pressure to
			that require for traction purposes.</p>
		<p>The new machine has not yet been tried commercially, but it is understood that
			transverters are being built by the <company name="Other">English Electric
				Company</company> which, it is hoped, will be in commercial service in
				<loc>London</loc> this year.</p>
