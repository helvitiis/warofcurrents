        <p><persName ref="#Tesla">Mr. Nikola Tesla</persName>, to whom the English and French
            scientific public has just accorded a very warm reception, is a pioneer in electric
            science, and one of those who will have influenced future progress through an almost
            radical transformation of the old processes and old methods.</p>
        <p>Some day we shall have occasion to describe the two <current type="AC">alternating
                current</current> motors devised by <persName ref="#Tesla">Mr. Tesla</persName> as
            long ago as 1888. At present, we shall content ourselves with recurring to his
            magnificent experiments on high potentials and <current type="AC">alternating
                currents</current> of great frequency, of which we have already given a complete
            idea in summarizing the communication made by the author on the <date xsd="1891-05-30"
                >30th of May, 1891</date>, before the American Institute of Electrical
            Engineers.</p>
        <p>In the train of this communication, which made a very great sensation in the scientific
            world, <persName ref="#Tesla">Mr. Tesla</persName>, acceding to the pressing
            solicitations of his friends and admirers, came to <loc>Europe</loc> and performed at
                <loc>London</loc> on February 3rd, and at Paris on the 19th of the same month,
            before the French Society of Physics and the International Society of Electricians,
            assembled in the hall of the Society of Encouragement, the remarkable experiments of
            which we were witness and of which we propose to give an idea, despite the dryness of
            the subject, its very special character, and our inability to make a clear exposition of
            it.</p>
        <p><persName ref="#Tesla">Mr. Tesla</persName> did not content himself with a simple
            repetition of the experiments made in <loc>America</loc>, but he extended them and
            rendered them complete, and the communications made in <loc>Europe</loc> may be
            considered as the second part of a long and remarkable study of which the first part was
            presented in the New World last year.</p>
        <p>In the first place, let us briefly recall the processes employed by <persName
                ref="#Tesla">Mr. Tesla</persName> for the production of <current type="AC"
                >alternating currents</current> of great frequency. The simplest consists in the use
            of an alternator of special form, which is represented herewith in Fig. 2. This consists
            of a steel disk 30 inches in diameter, upon which are mounted 384 small bobbins, or,
            more accurately, 384 small zigzag windings. This disk revolves in the interior of a
            fixed ring carrying 384 inductor poles. The result is that the frequency of the <current
                type="AC">alternating currents</current> engendered by the revolution of the
            armature before the inductors produces 193 periods per revolution, and that at the
            normal maximum velocity of 3,000 revolutions per minute, or 30 per second, a frequency
            of 9,600 periods per second is obtained, instead of the hundred solely that ordinary
            alternators give. The <current type="AC">alternating current</current> thus engendered
            is collected through the aid of two rings against which two brushes rub, as in all
            alternators with movable armature.</p>
        <p>A separate excitation permits of varying at will the alternator’s electro-motive force,
            which, under full excitation, may reach 300 volts. In the second process employed by
                <persName ref="#Tesla">Mr. Tesla</persName> for obtaining much greater frequencies,
            which may reach and even exceed a million per second, he utilizes an ordinary
            alternator. In the experiments of February 19, he employed a <company name="Siemens"
                >Siemens</company> alternator, whose frequency did not exceed fifty periods per
            second.</p>
        <p>The <current type="AC">alternating current</current> thus produced is sent to an
            induction coil by establishing in derivation, upon the primary circuit, a disruptive
            discharge apparatus formed of a condenser and two polished bans whose distance apart may
            be varied This spacing regulates the frequency of the discharges, and, consequently, the
            frequency of the currents traversing the inductor of the bobbin. The sparks of the
            disruptive discharges burst forth in a powerful magnetic, field which facilitates their
            rapid production, as well as the cooling of the space wherein they are produced with so
            great a rapidity. Whatever be the process employed for obtaining great frequencies, the
            potential is always inadequate, and it is increased by transforming the <current
                type="AC">alternating current</current> by the aid of a suitable bobbin. This latter
            consists of an internal inductor winding and an external armature winding, formed of
            relatively coarse wire, and of a number of quite small spirals; for it must not be lost
            sight of that, seeing the great frequency of the currents, the electromotive force
            developed for a given length of wire is incomparably higher than with ordinary bobbins.
            These bobbins have no iron core, and are completely submerged in boiled linseed oil; the
            object of which is to secure perfect insulation and to prevent the presence of air,
            which, in this particular case, would be very prejudicial through the considerable
            heating that it would produce under the action of the enormous and frequently reversed
            electrostatic tensions to which it would be submitted.</p>
        <p>In order to obtain powerful effects, <persName ref="#Tesla">Mr. Tesla</persName>
            overcomes the prejudicial effects of self-induction by utilizing the properties of
            condensers properly interposed in the circuit of the alternator or in derivation upon
            the terminals of the disruptive discharge apparatus. A certain number of the experiments
            made by <persName ref="#Tesla">Mr. Tesla</persName> on Feb. 19 were merely a
            reproduction of those that we have spoken of before. We shall therefore not reproduce
            them, but shall dwell more especially upon those that present a character of
            novelty.</p>

        <heading>Fig. 2, TESLA’S RAPID ALTERNATOR.</heading>

        <p>The first experiments were made with the disruptive discharge apparatus, that which gives
            the greatest frequencies at present obtainable by tho means at our disposal. In these
            conditions, the electrostatic discharges traverse the air under the form of luminous
            discharges, as if the air were rarefied. On interposing an ebonite plate, the
            electrostatic capacity of the system formed by the two balls between which the discharge
            takes place and the ebonite plate is increased by the interposition of a dielectric
            whose specific inductive capacity is greater than that of the air, and the brightness of
            the discharges is thereby intensified. These discharges easily traverse long tubes
            containing rarefied gases, which they illuminate with a bright light, each rarefied gas
            giving to the light its own distinctive color. The discharges occur likewise between two
            cotton-covered wires insulated from each other and put in connection with the two
            terminals of tho bobbin. These wires emit a violet light throughout their entire length,
            and even render luminous the space comprised between them.</p>

        <heading>Kg. 1,—PARIS-MR. TESLA LECTURING BEFORE THE FRENCH PHYSICAL SOCIETY AND THE
            INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF ELECTRICIANS.</heading>

        <p>All the other experiments were made with the alternator shown in Fig. 3, which gives from
            9,000 to 10,000 periods per second. <persName ref="#Tesla">Mr. Tesla</persName> first
            showed the discharges in the form of a flame.</p>
        <p>In order to prove that these discharges of high potential and great frequency are not
            dangerous, he was able, on taking in his hands two metallic balls designed to prevent
            his being burned by the spark, to receive the entire discharge from the bobbin, the
            discharge passing through his body interposed between the two balls. <persName
                ref="#Tesla">Mr. Tesla</persName> afterward showed that the return wire is
            absolutely useless for making the discharge current pass. The latter may be established
            by the air, and pass more easily if care be taken to connect one of the extremities of
            the wire of the bobbin with a conducting plate insulated in space. The molecular
            bombardment heats the part which presents but little surface put in communication with
            the second pole of the bobbin, and it was thus that <persName ref="#Tesla">Mr.
                Tesla</persName> showed us the incandescence of a thin platinum wire or of a carbon
            filament inclosed in a globe of rarefied air.</p>
        <p>Every increase in the capacity of the system increases the discharge current, and,
            consequently, the incandescence. It suffices, for example, to bring the hand near the
            globe containing the incandescent body, and to place a metallic shade above the latter,
            or even (an effect paradoxical in appearance) to place the shade alongside of the globe,
            to produce an increase of brightness resulting from the increase of the electrostatic
            capacity.</p>
        <p>The wire to which the filament is attached is connected, sis we have said, with the
            secondary wire of the bobbin, whose other wire communicates with an insulated metallic
            plate. Such metallic communication is not indispensable. In fact, if the wire is covered
            with lead, a layer of gutta peroha entirely insulating the copper wire and the leaden
            tube that envelops it, the lamp with a single filament becomes lighted as brilliantly
            when it is put in communication with the copper wire or the leaden tube.</p>
        <p><persName ref="#Tesla">Mr. Tesla</persName> thus actuated a Crookes electric radiator,
            and even a special single wire motor, to describe which would lead us too far. He
            afterward illuminated certain bodies that are but mediocre conductors, such as alumina,
            carbon, lime, “carborundum,” and a few phosphorescent bodies, such as sulphide of
            calcium, yttria, sulphide of zinc, and the ruby, the marvelous effects of which several
            times gained the unanimous applause of the spectators. <persName ref="#Tesla">Mr.
                Tesla</persName> finally terminated with a few experiments in the illumination of
            tubes of rarefied gases without wires or electrodes, the tubes being simply placed in
            the periodical electrostatic field produced between one of the insulated poles of the
            bobbin on the one hand and an insulated metallic plate placed above the experimenter and
            communicating with the other pole of the bobbin on the other hand.</p>
        <p>Fig. 1 shows one of these experiments, in which <persName ref="#Tesla">Mr.
                Tesla</persName> is producing the illumination of two tubes at once. In order to
            effect the extinction of one of these tubes, it suffices to interpose a middlingly
            conductive screeh in the electrostatic field, or to place the tube in a direction
            sensibly perpendicular to the flux of induction of the field. The same tube remains dark
            in all positions if it is held by its two extremities at once, the body forming a
            screen. On sliding the hand along the tube, it is possible to render one of its'
            extremities luminous. Nothing is more curious than to see the light produced by this
            process thus extinguished and relighted at will.</p>
        <p>Such are, very briefly described, the principal experiments which, for more than two
            hours, deeply interested the members of the two societies mentioned above, who had the
            good fortune to be present at <persName ref="#Tesla">Mr. Tesla’s</persName> lecture.</p>
        <p>It would be difficult as yet to say what future is in store for them from the standpoint
            of an industrial, utilitarian and practical new mode of production of light. The more so
            as the dream of the inventor is broader and his views more exalted than the expert-ments
            that he presented to us allow to be seen. His final ambition appears to be to transform
            the energy of the medium that environs us, and which is very evident by its numerous
            manifestations, into light, or at least to obtain therefrom radiations of the same wave
            length and same frequency as those that produce luminous sensations. Crookes’ radiometer
            has already proved that it is possible to convert the radiant energy of a medium
            directly into mechanical energy, and although, from the standpoint of rendering, this
            radiometer is the most detestable of all transformation apparatus, it is none the less
            the most admirable, by the fact that it affords us a tangible demonstration of the
            possibility of such transformation.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, <persName ref="#Tesla">Mr. Tesla</persName>, in his memorable
            experiments, has shown us that, on periodically varying, with very great frequency, an
            electrostatic field, it is possible to place apparatus of great simplicity therein, such
            as tubes of rarefied gases, which collect a portion of such energy and render it
            luminous. To the philosopher and savant nothing more is necessary to establish the
            possibility, if not the probability, of the realization of <persName ref="#Tesla">Mr.
                Tesla’s</persName> final views. To him the light of the future resides in the
            incandescence of solids, gases, and phosphorescent bodies excited (if we may use a
            somewhat vague expression) by high potentials varying with very great frequency.</p>
        <p>The young scientist is convinced of this as a precursor, and almost as a prophet. He
            introduces so much warmth and sincerity into his explanations and experiments that faith
            wins us, and, despite ourselves, we believe that we are witnesses of the dawn of a
            nearby revolution in the present processes of illumination. —B. Hospitaller, in Ba
            Nature.</p>
