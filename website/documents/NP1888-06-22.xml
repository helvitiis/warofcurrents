        <p>The interest taken in <persName ref="#Tesla">Mr. Tesla's</persName> contributions to
            electrical apparatus and to electrical literature is so great, and the subject is so
            important, that we do not hesitate to give further space to the subject. On <date
                xsd="1888-05-26">May 26</date> a communication on the subject from <persName
                ref="#Other">Dr. Louis Duncan</persName>, of Johns Hopkins University, appeared in
            our American contemporary, the Electrical Review, to the effect:</p>
        <p>"We may, for our present purposes, divide motors into two classes; Continuous, in which
            the armature coils are unsymmetrical with respect to the poles, and which, therefore,
            give a practically constant torque, and alternating motors, in which the armature coils
            are symmetrical with respect to the poles, and which, therefore, give a torque varying
            both in magnitude and sign during a period of the counter E.M.F. The <persName
                ref="#Tesla">Tesla</persName> motor belongs to this latter class.</p>
        <p>"In every motor the torque is equal to the rate of change of lines of induction through
            the armature circuit for a small angular displacement, multiplied by the armature
            current, or dm/dt.</p>
        <p>In the <persName ref="#Tesla">Tesla</persName> motor the first of these terms is greatest
            when the coil is opposite a pole and the field currents have their greatest amplitude.
            It is zero at a point about 45 deg. from this, supposing we neglect armature reactions.
            It depends on several things. The E.M.F. which determines it is due to changes in the
            number of lines of force passing through the armature circuit caused by (1) changes in
            the field currents; (2) the motion of the armature. The current depends on these
            E.M.F.'s, and on the reduced self-induction and resistance of its circuit. The motor can
            only do work when the first cause of E.M.F. is the greater, for a current in the
            direction of the ordinary counter E.M.F. would stop the motion. In some parts of a
            revolution the two E.M.F.'s work together, retarding the motion; in others, the induced
            E.M.F. produces a current causing the motor to revolve. It is impossible for me, with
            only a meagre description of the principles of the machine, to give an idea of the
            relative magnitude of these effects. Some of the results, however, are the following:
            Having given a definite number of reversals of the dynamo, there are a number of speeds,
            multiples of these reversals, at which the motor will govern itself when it is doing a
            certain amount of work. At one of these speeds, depending on the construction of the
            motor, the output will be a maximum. Now I see the statement that 'there is no
            difficulty whatever attendant upon starting the motor under load.' I cannot reconcile
            this with the above facts. That the torque for a smaller number of revolutions than
            ordinarily used, might be greater, one can readily see, since the counter E.M.F. is less
            in proportion to the induced E.M.F., but it must be remembered that for certain speeds
            even the induced current would tend to stop the motion; how the motor is to pass these
            critical speeds I do not see. Again, if the maximum load is suddenly thrown on while the
            motor is running at its proper speed, then, if the inertia be great, the motor will fall
            behind its point of maximum work, and either stop or take up some slower speed.</p>
        <p>"What the possible efficiency and output of the motor may be, only experiment will tell.
            I have shown (Inst. Elec. Engineers, Feb., 1888.) that the output of an ordinary
                <current type="AC">alternating current</current> motor is equal to that of a
            continuous current motor, supplied with a corresponding ing E.M.F. The efficiency might
            be great, but is has the disadvantage that about the same current flows for no work and
            maximum work, so for light loads the efficiency can hardly be very high.</p>
        <p>"With our present knowledge of <current type="AC">alternating currents</current> it is
            useless to attempt to calculate from the simple though misleading assumptions ordinarily
            made, the output, conditions of maximum work &amp; of this machine. Experiment alone can
            determine its value, and one properly conducted and interpreted set of experiments
            should enable us to judge both the merit of the invention and its best possible form. I
            cannot see, however, how, in the form described in the last issue of this journal the
            motor can work under conditions of a suddenly varying load as satisfactorily as
            continuous current motors."</p>
        <p>To the above <persName ref="#Tesla">Mr. Tesla</persName> replied on <date
                xsd="1888-06-02">June 2</date> as follows:</p>
        <p>"I find in your issue of last week a note of <persName ref="#Other">Mr. Duncan</persName>
            referring to my system of <current type="AC">alternate current</current> motors. "</p>
        <p>As I see that <persName ref="#Other">Dr. Duncan</persName> has not as yet been made
            acquainted with the real character of my invention, I cannot consider his article in the
            light of a serious criticism, and would think it unnecessary to respond; but desiring to
            express my consideration for him and the importance which I attach to his opinion, I
            will point out here briefly the characteristic features of my invention, inasmuch as
            they have a direct bearing on the article above referred to.</p>
        <p>"The principle of action of my motor will be well understood from the following: By
            passing <current type="AC">alternate currents</current> in proper manner through
            independent evergising circuits in the motor, a progressive shifting or rotation of the
            poles of the same is effected. This shifting is more or less continuous according to the
            construction of the motor and the character and relative phase of the currents which
            should exist in order to secure the most perfect action.</p>
        <p>"If a laminated ring be wound with four coils, and the same be connected in proper order
            to two independent circuits of an <current type="AC">alternate current</current>
            generator adapted for this purpose, the passage of the currents through the coils
            produces theoretically a rotation of the poles of the ring, and in actual practice, in a
            series of experiments, I have demonstrated the complete analogy between such a ring and
            a revolving magnet. From the application of this principle to the operation of motors,
            two forms of motor of a character widely differing have resulted â€” one designed for
            constant and the other for variable load. The misunderstanding of <persName ref="#Other"
                >Dr. Duncan</persName> is due to the fact that the prominent features of each of
            these two forms have not been specifically stated. In illustration of a representative
            of the second class, I refer to Fig. 1, given herewith. In this instance, the armature
            of the motor is provided with two coils at right angles. As it may be believed that a
            symmetrical arrangement of the coils with respect to the poles is required, I will
            assume that the armature is provided with a great number of diametrically wound coils or
            conductors closed upon themselves, and forming as many independent circuits. Let it now
            be supposed that the ring is permanently magnetized so as to show two poles (N and S) at
            two points diametrically opposite, and that it is rotated by mechanical power. The
            armature being stationary, the rotation of the ring magnet will set up currents in the
            closed armature coils. These currents will be most intense at or near the points of the
            greatest density of the force, and they will produce poles upon the armature core at
            right angles to those of the ring. Of course there will be other elements entering into
            action which will tend to modify this, but for the present they may be left
            unconsidered. As far as the location of the poles upon the armature core is concerned,
            the currents generated in the armature coils will always act in the same manner, and
            will maintain continuously the poles of the core in the same position, with respect to
            those of the ring in any position of the latter, and independently of the speed. From
            the attraction between the core and the ring, a continuous rotary effort, constant in
            all positions, will result, the same as in a continuous current motor with a great
            number of armature coils. If the armature be allowed to turn, it will revolve in the
            direction of rotation of the ring magnet, the induced current diminishing as the speed
            increases, until upon the armature reaching very nearly the speed of the magnet, just
            enough current will flow through the coils to keep up the rotation. If, instead of
            rotating the ring by mechanical power, the poles of the same are shifted by the action
            of the <current type="AC">alternate currents</current> in the two circuits, the same
            results are obtained.</p>
        <p>"Now compare this system with a continuous current system. In the latter we have <current
                type="AC">alternate currents</current> in the generator and motor coils, and
            intervening devices for commutating the currents, which on the motor besides effect
            automatically a progressive shifting or rotation of the poles of the armature; here we
            have the same elements and identically the same operation, but without the commutating
            devices. In view of the fact that these devices are entirely unessential to the
            operation, such <current type="AC">alternate current</current> system will â€” at least in
            many respects â€” show a complete similarity with a continuous current system, and the
            motor will act precisely like a continuous current motor. If the load is augmented, the
            speed is diminished and the rotary effort correspondingly increased, as more current is
            made to pass through the energising circuits; load being taken off, the speed increases,
            and the current, and consequently the effort, is lessened. The effort, of course, is
            greatest when the armature is in the state of rest.</p>
        <p>"But, since the analogy is complete, how about the maximum efficiency and current passing
            through the circuits when the motor is running without any load? one will naturally
            inquire. It must be remembered that we have to deal with <current type="AC">alternate
                currents</current>. In this form the motor simply represents a transformer, in which
            currents are induced by a dynamic action instead of by reversals, and, as it might be
            expected, the efficiency will be maximum at full load. As regards the current, there
            will be â€” at least, under proper conditions â€” as wide a variation in its strength as in
            a transformer, and, by observing proper rules, it may be reduced to any desired
            quantity. Moreover, the current passing through the motor when running free, is no
            measure for the energy absorbed, since the instruments indicate only the numerical sum
            of the <current type="DC">direct</current> and induced electromotive forces and currents
            instead of showing their difference.</p>
        <p>"Regarding the other class of these motors, designed for constant speed, the objections
            of <persName ref="#Other">Dr. Duncan</persName> are, in a measure applicable to certain
            constructions, but it should be considered that such motors are not expected to run
            without any, or with a very light load; and, if so, they do not, when properly
            constructed, present in this respect any more disadvantage than transformers under
            similar conditions. Besides, both features, rotary effort and tendency to constant
            speed, may be combined in a motor, and any desired preponderance may be given to either
            one, and in this manner a motor may be obtained possessing any desired character and
            capable of satisfying any possible demand in practice.</p>
        <p>"In conclusion, I will remark, with all respect to <persName ref="#Other">Dr.
                Duncan</persName>, that the advantages claimed for my system are not mere
            assumptions, but results actually obtained, and that for this purpose experiments have
            been conducted through a long period, and with an assiduity such as only a deep interest
            in the invention could inspire; nevertheless, although my motor is the fruit of long
            labour and careful investigation, I do not wish to claim any other merit beyond that of
            having invented it, and I leave it to men more competent than with <current type="AC"
                >alternate currents</current>. In this form the motor simply represents a
            transformer, in which currents are induced by a dynamic action instead of by reversals,
            and, as it might be expected, the efficiency will be maximum at full load. As regards
            the current, there will be â€” at least, under proper conditions â€” as wide a variation in
            its strength as in a transformer, and, by observing proper rules, it may be reduced to
            any desired quantity. Moreover, the current passing through the motor when running free,
            is no measure for the energy absorbed, since the instruments indicate only the numerical
            sum of the <current type="DC">direct</current> and induced electromotive forces and
            currents instead of showing their difference. "Regarding the other class of these
            motors, designed for constant speed, the objections of <persName ref="#Other">Dr.

            should be considered that such motors are not expected to run without any, or with a
            very light load; and, if so, they do not, when properly constructed, present in this
            respect any more disadvantage than transformers under similar conditions. Besides, both
            features, rotary effort and tendency to constant speed, may be combined in a motor, and
            any desired preponderance may be given to either one, and in this manner a motor may be
            obtained possessing any desired character and capable of satisfying any possible demand
            in practice. "In conclusion, I will remark, with all respect to <persName ref="#Other"

            having invented it, and I leave it to men more competent than myself to determine the
            true laws of the principle and the best mode of its application. What the result of
            these investigations will be the future will tell; but whatever they may be, and to
            whatever this principle may lead, I shall be sufficiently recompensed if later it will
            be admitted that I have contributed a share, however small, to the advancement of
            science."</p>
