<p><persName ref="#Other">Martin A. Frank</persName>, who owns thirty-one shares of the stock of the <company name="Edison">Edison Electric Light Company</company>, has taken proceedings in the <loc>Supreme Court</loc> against that company and the <company name="Edison">Edison General Electric Company</company>, and threatens to apply for an injunction and appointment of a receiver of an <company name="Edison">electric light company</company>. Its capital stock is $1,500,000.</p>

<p><persName ref="#Other">Frank</persName> asserts that a majority of the stockholders and directors of the<company name="Edison"> light company</company> have diverted the assets and property and have turned them to a purpase which was neither contemplated by the character of the company nor is permitted under the laws of this <loc>State</loc>. He says a majority of the officers, directors and stockholders of the <company name="Edison">light company</company> organized the <company name="Edison">Edison General Electric Company</company>, which has secured possession of a large part of the stock of the <company name="Edison">light company</company>, and has secured control of its property and of its operations, and also the election of its officers.</p>

<p><persName ref="#Other">Mr. Frank</persName> further complains that no dividend has ever been declared or paid by the <company name="Edison">light company</company>, but that its earnings have been accumulating without the consent of the stockholders.</p>

<p><persName ref="#Other">Frank</persName> secured an order from the <loc>Court</loc> for the examinataion of <persName ref="#Other">Edward H. Johnson</persName>, who is a dierector in both companies.</p>

<p>The <company name="Edison">Edison companies</company> yesterday applied to <persName ref="#Other">Judge Ingraham</persName>, in <loc>Supreme Court</loc>, <loc>Chambers</loc>, to have the order vacated, because it would give a small stockholder the opportunity of getting at secrets which should not be revealed at this time.</p>

<p><persName ref="#Other">Judge Ingraham</persName> thought <persName ref="#Other">Johnson's</persName> examination was perfectly proper, but said he would consider the question.</p>
