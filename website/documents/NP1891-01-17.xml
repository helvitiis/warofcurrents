        <p><loc>Pittsburgh, Pa</loc>., <date xsd="1891-01-16"> Jan. 16, 1891</date>.--The latest
            guess at the probable outcome of the financial troubles of the <company
                name="Westinghouse">Westinghouse Electric Manurfacturing Company</company> is that
            under the terms "of consolidation" the <company name="Westinghouse">Westinghouse
                company</company> will be absorbed by its great Eastern rival, the <company
                    name="Thomson-Houston">Thomson-Houston company</company>. Officials of the <company
                        name="Westinghouse">Westinghouse company</company> will not talk of this, but it is
            known that the chief counsel for the <company name="Thomson-Houston">Thomson-Houston
                company</company> has been consultation for several days with representatives of the
            <company name="Westinghouse">Westinghouse</company> interests.</p>
        <p><persName ref="#Other">Henry W. Long</persName>, a leading broker and heavy holder of
            <company name="Westinghouse">Westinghouse</company> stock, said to-day he considered
            a receivership of the <company name="Westinghouse">Westinghouse company</company> or
            consolidation inevitable. He considers consolidation more likely to result in good for
            the stockholders than a receivership.</p>
        <p><persName ref="#Westinghouse">Mr. Westinghouse</persName> did not return to
            <loc>Pittsburg</loc> to-day, but wired that he still has strong hopes of placing
            enough of the preferred stock of his company to enable it to weather the storm. it is
            understood no new suits will be entered until <date xsd="1891-01-26">January 26</date>,
            the first return day. Creditors can gain nothing moving before, and the feeling is
            general in favor of giving <persName ref="#Westinghouse">Mr. Westinghouse</persName> all the time possible. On this account the
            action of the advisory board in returning their checks to contributors to the $500,000
            relief fund during the absence from the city of  <persName ref="#Westinghouse">Mr. Westinghouse</persName>and making public
            announcement of the fact is severely criticised.</p>
        <p><company name="Other">The Philadelphia company</company>, a <persName ref="#Westinghouse">Westinghouse</persName> concern which controls the natural gas supply
            and <loc>Pittsburgh</loc>, and which has been carrying a heavy floating debt and paying eight and
            twelve per cent dividends, decided to-day to pay no more dividends until the
            indebtedness is wiped out. The officers of the company say it is sound financially.</p>
