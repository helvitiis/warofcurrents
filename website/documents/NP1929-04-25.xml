		<p>At the hearing yesterday on the complaint of John F. Hylan, made when he was Mayor, that
			rates for electric current charged by the Edison companies were too high, Public Service
				<persName ref="#Other">Commissioner Pooley</persName> announced that <persName
				ref="#Other">Matthew S. Sloan</persName>, president of the <loc>New York</loc>
			<company name="Edison">Edison Company</company>, had been asked to testify when the
			hearing is resumed next Tuesday. At the hearings by the Public Service Commission on
			submetering <persName ref="#Other">Mr. Sloan</persName> testified that if the profits
			made by the submeter concerns had not been diverted from the electric companies it would
			have been possible to reduce the rates.</p>
		<p><persName ref="#Other">Commissioner Pooley</persName>, it was explained, wants to learn
			the policy of the <company name="Edison">Edison Company</company> concerning the
			extension or discontinuance of the <current type="DC">direct current</current> system.
			The commission contends that this system is more costly to operate and maintain than the
			more modern system of <current type="AC">alternating current</current>. It was suggested
			that it might be possible to obtain a reduction in the rates for electric current if the
			company adopted the most economical methods of operation.</p>
		<p>Reports were submitted to show that the return on the investment of the company will
			yield only a little more than 4 per cent this year, instead of the 8 per cent allowed by
			law. This report was submitted by <persName ref="#Other">Henry M. Edwards</persName>,
			vice president of the company on charge of accounting.</p>
		<p>According to this estimate, the total value of the company's investment will amount to
			$469,474,730.19 by the end of the year. This indicates that the value has almost doubled
			since July 1, 1924. At that time <persName ref="#Other">Dr. William
			McClellan</persName>, on behalf of the commission, submitted an estimate showing that
			the value was $245,574,784.66, which was about $100,000,000 lower that the company's
			estimate.</p>
