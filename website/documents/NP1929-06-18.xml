		<p><persName ref="#Other">Robert B. Thomas</persName>, counsel for the <company name="Other"
				>Structural Steel Board of Trade, Inc.</company>, appeared before <persName
				ref="#Other">Chairman Prendergast</persName> of the Public Service Commission
			yesterday in support of the complaint of the board that the <loc>New York</loc>
			<company name="Edison">Edison Company</company> had refused to furnish <current
				type="DC">direct current</current> to contractors for the temporary use during the
			construction of buildings.</p>
		<p>The <company name="Edison">Edison Company</company>, after a study of the situation in
			its territory, determined to supply <current type="AC">alternating current</current> to
			all consumers except those who had installed <current type="DC">direct current</current>
			equipment in buildings. This situation remains. <persName ref="#Other">Mr.
				Thomas</persName> said that the cost of the <current type="DC">direct
				current</current> equipment used by contractors was in some cases in excess of
			$50,000. He protested against any situation that would mean the scrapping of it.</p>
		<p>He asserted that the company had encouraged builders to provide themselves with this
			costly equipment and thought the company should pay for it if a change in the method of
			furnishing current had destroyed its value. It was explained that <current type="AC"
				>alternating current</current> was rapidly taking the place of <current type="DC"
				>direct current</current> throughout the country, because it was cheaper to install
			and to operate. This <current type="DC">direct current</current> equipment, <persName
				ref="#Other">Mr. Thomas</persName> said, had cost steel contractors at least
			$2,000,000. It was suggested that it would only be fair if the company continued to
			supply <current type="DC">direct current</current> to those contractors who wanted it
			until their equipment was worn out, which might occur in ten years.</p>
		<p><persName ref="#Other">William L. Ransom</persName>, counsel for the company, said that
			its president, <persName ref="#Other">Matthew S. Sloan</persName>, would not consent to
			the company's plant that would only serve a temporary purpose. At a hearing before the
			commission on <date xsd="1929-05-27">May 27</date>, last, representatives of building
			firms which are members of the <company name="Other">Steel Board of Trade</company>,
			said that <persName ref="#Other">Mr. Sloan</persName> was dictatorial and responsible
			for innovations that were troublesome.</p>
		<p><persName ref="#Other">Chairman Prendergast</persName> won a promise from <persName
				ref="#Other">Mr. Ransom</persName> that the company would supply <current type="DC"
				>direct current</current> to building contractors whenever it was possible without
			further investment on the company's part. If the company and the contractors cannot
			reach an amicable agreement he later were told that they could file a formal complaint
			with the commission and that hearings would be held so that the case might be fully
			inquired into.</p>
