		<p>Declaring that <current type="AC">alternating current</current> was less expensive to
			produce than <current type="DC">direct current</current>, <persName ref="#Rau">Otto M.
				Rau</persName>, consulting engineer of <loc>Philadelphia</loc>, who testified
			yesterday for the city before the Public Service Commission in the case started five
			years ago by the city to bring about a reduction in the <loc>New York</loc>
			<company name="Edison">Edison Company's</company> rates, proposed that the company
			replace its <current type="DC">direct current</current> equipment with <current
				type="AC">alternating current</current> plants throughout the city. Replying to
				<persName ref="#Rau">Mr. Rau's</persName> proposal, <persName ref="#Other">Jacob H,
				Goetz</persName>, counsel for the <company name="Edison">Edison Company</company>,
			characterized the <persName ref="#Rau">Rau</persName> plan as "the most far-reaching
			effort to scrap a system of properties ever heard in a rate case." The whole theory of
			the substitute plant, he said, had been ruled against by the United States Supreme Court
			in the <loc>Indianapolis</loc> water case before <persName ref="#Other">Justice
				Butler</persName>. "To recognize any such testimony on such a flimsy basis would
			make any decision of the commission vulnerable," <persName ref="#Other">Mr.
				Goetz</persName> said. <persName ref="#Other">Commissioner William R.
				Pooley</persName>, hearing the case, agreed with <persName ref="#Other">Mr.
				Goetz</persName> with the reminder that "we are dealing with a plant as it now
			exists and not with a hypothetical plant." The admissibility of testimony of <persName
				ref="#Other">Malcolm F. Orton</persName>, accountant, on the valuation of the
				<loc>New York</loc>
			<company name="Edison">Edison Company</company> from documentary analyses of accounts
			dating back to 1901 was questioned by <persName ref="#Other">Mr. Goetz</persName> on the
			ground that the figures were too remote and therefore not proper elements in determining
			the present cost of service. He agreed to the admission of the records but reserved the
			right to contest certain portions later when he has checked the sources of testimony.
			Challenges 1901 Valuation.</p>
		<p>The city, according to <persName ref="#Other">Assistant Corporation Counsel Joseph P.
				Morrissey</persName>, challenges the company's figure of $79,000,000 as of <date
				xsd="1901-05-01">May 1, 1901</date>, as representing the actual cost of the property
			that went into the merger of a group of smaller utility companies at that time. The
			actual cost of property that went into the figure, <persName ref="#Other">Mr.
				Morrissey</persName> said, was $23,000,000 about $60,000,000 being "water." The
			retirement of property in existence prior to 1901, he said, he was $4,000,000, or 5 per
			cent, while the property retired since that time runs to 40 or 50 per cent. "The
			financial history of the company," <persName ref="#Other">Mr. Morrissey</persName> told
				<persName ref="#Other">Commissioner Pooley</persName>, "is peculiarly materials in
			the case because the company is claiming a 'going value.' The courts have said in many
			cases that the financial history of the company should be taken into consideration in
			any determination of 'going value.' We contend that the actual cost of the property at
			present owned by the utility and used in utility service is an element that must be
			considered in fixing fair value." <persName ref="#Other">Mr. Morrissey</persName>
			declared that the United States Supreme Court had ruled in a large number of cases that
			testimony concerning was relavant and proper material for consideration in fixing rates.
			Puts "$12,000,000 Plant" at $1,250,000.</p>
		<p><persName ref="#Other">Mr. Rau</persName> presented figures to show that the capital
			investment to produce the amount of current now generated at the company's <loc>Duane
				Street</loc> plant would not excede $1,250,000. According to the company's figures,
			he said, the plant was valued at $12,000,000. <persName ref="#Rau">Mr. Rau's</persName>
			testimony brought out that about 90 per cent of the generating plant had been
			dismantled. <persName ref="#Other">Jacob H. Goetz</persName>, counsel for the company,
			explained that plants of the <loc>Brooklyn</loc>
			<company name="Edison">Edison Company</company> now furnished the power once supplied by
			the <loc>Duane Street</loc> plant. <persName ref="#Other">Mr. Morrissey</persName>
			recalled that an antiquated generator used in the <loc>Duane Street</loc> plant had been
			sent to the <loc>Ford Museum</loc>, and asked if the company had included the "museum
			valuation" of such property in arriving at the valuation of the <loc>Duane Street</loc>
			plant. <persName ref="#Rau">Mr. Rau's</persName> report of the valuation of the
				<loc>Duane Street</loc> plant had been ruled out at a previous hearing by <persName
				ref="#Other">Chairman Prendergast</persName> because the witness said it was a
			brief. <persName ref="#Other">Mr. Morrissey</persName> declared that the witness did not
			think it was a brief in the legal sense but an engineer's report which should have been
			allowed to remain as the opinion of an expert. <persName ref="#Other">Commissioner
				Pooley</persName> reserved decision but allowed its admission as <persName
				ref="#Rau">Mr. Rau's</persName> direct testimony. The hearing was adjourned until
			Feb. 5 at 10:30 A. M.</p>
