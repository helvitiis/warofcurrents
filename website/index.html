        <p>In the late 1800s, businessman and inventor <span style="color:maroon">Thomas
                Edison</span> was developing a practical application of direct (or DC) current to
            power homes, businesses, and entire cities. However, he was quickly presented with a
            serious issue--direct current could not be converted to higher or lower voltages, and it
            could not be transferred reliably over long distances. </p>
        <div style="text-align:center">

        </div>
        <p>Meanwhile, <span style="color:teal">Nikola Tesla</span>, a Serbian immigrant with
            extensive backgrounds in physics and engineering, received a patent for his alternating
            current (or AC) induction motor. This motor, in short, posed a solution to many of the
            issues DC motors presented, and paved the way for alternating current to give direct
            current a run for its money.</p>
        <p><span style="color:darkslateblue">George Westinghouse</span>, inventor and industrialist,
            bought <span style="color:teal">Tesla's</span> patents and implemented them on a large
            scale basis to rival <span style="color:maroon">Edison's</span> growing business of
            monopolizing the electrical industry. <span style="color:maroon">Edison</span> noticed
            the efforts of the alternating current being used against direct current, and decided to
            campaign against it by spreading misinformation and playing up its dangers. He spent
            money on public electrocutions of animals and developed the electric chair to execute
            criminals. </p>
        <p>Alternating current looked like it might fail thanks to the efforts of <span
                style="color:maroon">Edison</span>--but this was soon to change.</p>
        <div style="text-align:center">
            <img src="worldsFair.png" alt="An image of The World's Fair."/>
        </div>
        <p>The Chicago World's Fair of 1893 was the greatest blow to <span style="color:maroon"
                >Edison</span> and his direct current monopoly. General Electric, owned by <span
                style="color:maroon">Edison</span>, petitioned to electrify the fair for $544,000.
            Westinghouse Electric Company however, owned by <span style="color:darkslateblue"
                >Westinghouse</span>, proposed a budget of $399,000 with use of <span
                style="color:teal">Tesla's</span> alternating current, and received the privilege of
            supplying the light. Alternating current was hailed as the superior to DC, and remains
            to this day the predominant current for large-scale power supply.</p>
        <p>The War of Currents project aims to inform you, the viewer, about the historical
            application and implications of AC versus DC current. This includes the public view of
            AC and DC current, the advertising and publicity (overall negative or positive
            adjectives and verbage used to describe them), public demonstrations, contributing
            figures (and who was the most/least mentioned), areas where electricity was most
            implemented, and a timeline to represent the dates of major events in the history of AC
            and DC current. Please enjoy our hard work! </p>
